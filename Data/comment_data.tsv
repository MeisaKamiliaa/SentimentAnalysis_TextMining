@fabfitforever4934	I’m interested in doing tech courses
@teclasicbaldi	i completed Everyday Excel Part 1 and everything went well. now i'm having issues with Everyday Excel Part 2 because the 2nd Assignment it's very far from the content of videos of the week, is definetely beyond the scope of the videos and i'm stuck there from a while now. i'm considering to give up 
@RodgersMasawi-ef5vc	Not yet, there are many things I need to understand about this platform? How can we communicate
@Redlights111	Idk about the certificates but I use their top university lessons to learn korean for free. I did one lesson today and I'm impressed.
@berryberrystrawberry2428	Do they take the lessons on meet? or are they video explanations?
@Redlights111	 @berryberrystrawberry2428  Video explanations but what I have used is very interractive and at the end of each video you can download worksheet with all the words just learned in the video. I have used yonsei university course to learn korean. The courses vary with different topics though.
@Redlights111	 @gradehacker  I'm conversational by now. I use mix of free resourses including the coursera courses.
@DeeSavageApocalypseThe1st	Was looking for data analyst related boot camps come to find that my local uni charges over 13000, yet Coursera is about 59$
@IAmHisBeloved5	Any update?
@zee9276	how did it go?? update please.
@Pixels_and_Points	Video lectures are not the same as in-person learning, where your work is reviewed by a learned expert, with feedback given, and with the ability to ask questions for clarification. Peer-grades aren't worth much. So, it's a big price difference but a big difference in what you're getting. (Still, we all know higher ed is overly priced now.)
@neelamchaudhry4457	You can applied for financial aid
@jegaevi7371	"Thank you for this in depth review! I think you were really fair.\n\nMy university gives out free Coursera to all of the students who want it, so I don't have to pay for certificates, but I think I would probably continue using the platform even after I graduated and didn't 't have free access anymore.\n\nI think it is a great way to deepen your knowledge in your own field, or try other, unfamiliar fields as well. All of the courses are high quality and a lot of them are even enjoyable to take and they never feel like a chore.\n\nMy only problem is that peer reviews are nothing more than a joke. It is not even that you are not reviewed by experts, but your course mates usually put zero effort into reviewing your work. I never got any constructive criticism, they usually just say ""Good."", probably without reading what I wrote, or say ""Could have been better"".\n\nAlso, I wish they had more subjects in Humanities. There are only a couple of literature/culture courses."
@psychedelictacos9118	So if you pay the 50 dollars per month you can do any of the courses that cost 50 dollars? its just kind of like a subscription to Netflix that gives you access to all of its shows apart from the advanced courses in this case that cost over $2000 USD??
@DHScuts	If we buy one course is it life time accessible or it will be over within the given period of time
@englishaa	Is peer graded assignment  compulsory for getting a certificate?
@mohammadfilvan8068	Hello, I signed up for the Teamwork and Creativity course, it has 5 modules. I have just answered the tasks of the first module and taken the final exam, which is subject to a fee. I wanted to ask if we have to pass all five modules in this mentioned course to get a certificate or can we get a certificate after passing the each module?
@jegaevi7371	You will get a certificate for each individual course and then one more when you complete all of them, aka complete the specialisation. This means that if you are only interested in completing certain courses, not all of them, you can, but to earn the final certificate you have to complete all of the courses.
@bilalqasmi9907	I'm an Electrical and Electronics Engineer. I want to persue career in Cyber Security of Microsoft Certification. What will be the cost all in all? I've researched and found out $49/month. How it'll be calculated if I finish in 3 months or in 6 months?
@ciegosanchez5289	Question: why do I get a certificate for each course I finish? Like they’ll be 4 parts and I get a certificate for all of them? Should it be just one final certificate at the end?
@TJPRINCEALLAH	so if i take a free course & succeed i have the option to pay for the certificate when i’m done?
@filipmachacek	Good, short and informative review. Nice vid. 
@goodbye_kitty_xoxo	Somehow it doesn’t let me have a free course, though it says the course is free. What may be a problem?
@elizabethmwaniah3765	Does it offer Accounting courses?
@EDGEHILLBBKE	I took several courses, great contents. My challenge here comes in and I need help with payment. I woud wish to do payment direct from bank is it an available option? Payment criteria CANNOT work for me where I am .
@DaferrFN	What about people that are not in university? \nI mean, I finished high school like 20 years ago and that was it.\nWould someone like me be able to learn the free courses? \nIt's not like I am that bright... unfortunantly.
@AM2PMReviews	I have only done two courses and it seems to have some boring structure and a lot of fluff. like they will have a 2 minute overview and then a 1 min conclusion on a topic I just saw.
@nazuada	Hey would you mind sharing which ones you did? I am thinking if Data Analysis is worth it
@LSOeaDASJD	i dont get it , so if im willing to take a computer science degree from scratch and lets say it takes me 3 years , how much will i pay ?
@srilekhareddy9877	What happens if we don't finish the subscription course in time?
@ELCHUCKO666	"Coursera is not an accredited platform per se?  WTF? ""Coursera Certificates Are Not Accredited. While a Coursera certificate can look good on your resume, it's important to keep in mind that these certificates are not accredited. That means they likely won't be accepted as credit towards a degree or other formal education program."""
@waybackretroreviews	Are Coursera Certificates certifiable to get a job?
@SamLozano	I see it's monthly.. once you get a certificate do you keep it after you stop paying their monthly fee.
@sonali.gokani	What is difference between course, specialization and prifessional certificate. I am a pm and want to learn ux, but so many options came. No idea which one to pick frin the beginner filter :(
@Bliss20244	Is it possible to do the course if I don't have a computer? Can I do everything through phone?
@typicalgamer5560	Should be possible as there is an app

@hajjalah	Am interested in skincare treatment 
@thaiduongnguyen501	can you review Brilliant?
@gonzojones8422	What’s to stop your class mate failing you because they want to?
@jegaevi7371	If someone gives you a bad review because they are trolling, you can just resubmit your assignment. It is annoying, but it won't have any negative effects on your grade. It does happen sometimes, but it is pretty rare. It is more common to receive max points.
@bsmathematicsbyvu8572	Any reviews my assignment plZ
@Ramkumar-uj9fo	Is there any scientific evidence of casteism or regionalism against Coursera, EdX, Future Learn, Udemy, Unanth ? Say yes or no\n\nNo\nWhat about pluralsight\n\nNo\nWhat about interaction design foundation or togaf\nNo.\n\nWhat about brainbench ?\nNo.\nWhat about guru nanak English high school, kalyan and boiler plant secondary high school trichy\n\nThere is no specific scientific evidence to suggest casteism or regionalism against these schools.\n\nChatGPT ️️\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT ️️
@askashutosh8667	Do we have to give qyizzes under webcam submission . What are readings in courses
@jegaevi7371	I've taken dozens of quizzes, non of them required a webcam.
@askashutosh8667	 @jegaevi7371  thanks for sharing is it for the professional course which had peer based assignment too.
@charlita25	He forgot the part where they ask for your credit card 
@jegaevi7371	 @gradehacker  They also offer financial aid for those who can't afford to pay for the courses.
@psy-locked2366	Seems like you were paid to puff them up.
@codyzimmerman2582	Lol so it's not accredited.. why waste your time then
@nonexistent5030	Accredited now.
@johnnyredding5024	@gradehacker how do I go to my descriptions & or apply for financial aid if needed ? Also how do I know how much the cost of the certificate will be once I finish the certificate program that I’m taking ?
@simmzzzz	Coursera is one of the biggest piles of trash I've ever seen. Major ripoff. Take a bootcamp course instead.
@abirbenchaouech4145	I completed 162 courses and 13 specialities on Coursera and i highly recommend it. The content quality of each course was really excellent
@vincentortega4284	Thanks for the info. Abir.
@abirbenchaouech4145	 @RichardWalls  Thank you  best of luck for you too
@OVXX666	did it impress employers? did it help you find a job?
@brooklynjune9201	 @abirbenchaouech4145  AMAZING  you are an inspiration.
@abirbenchaouech4145	 @brooklynjune9201  Thank you 
@hudzaifahibnuyaman7247	and for how long have you been using Coursera, or took you to earned those?
@shivanshvats7621	Can u recommend some language course like java and python on course era. And web development ?
@newadventure7854	How long it took you to do all of that !!
@emersonolivares9217	I'm a college grad and took two courses from Coursera and graduated with two certificates from Coursera. I was able to gain 24 credits from Coursera and transferred the credits to another University!
@thechocolatemonster3392	Did the institution you took the courses from give you credits? Or did you have to show it to your university and convince them to give you credits?
@triceyb8188	My concern is are they accredited courses for big universities
@kentadran	I was a drop out student last 5 years ago. Now I found coursera as my way of motivation and success to have a higher rate of getting a job.
@arain764niara	Did you get a job?
@Alchemist523	Did you get a job
@benjaminvalencia1017	 @arain764niara  I know right? LMAO
@kentadran	For those who asked if I got a job. Yes I have a job right now and also got a 2 part time jobs. One during weekdays and one in weekends.
@Seeker7257	 @kentadran  Hello, if you will, could you please share your experience on coursera as of now? Did you get a job facilitated by those courses? Thank you.
@kentadran	 @Seeker7257 my experience is overwhelming positive, it did gave me a new chance of studying as I got no professional degree. Yes I did have a job facilitated by those courses. I am now working on a Chemical Factory
@Seeker7257	 @kentadran  Thank you for reply, so accordingly, those courses have the potential to allocate an entry level job or the likes? That means, if we complete a particular course, we are left with opportunities, right? \n\nI am a collage dropout, and am wondering as to what these courses can do for me. Thank you.
@kentadran	 @Seeker7257  Yes, completing the course & having the knowledge of that will surely be something great to add unto your resume/cv/bio-data. There are several courses you can choose from, some requires payment some are not. I took a course which was made by a private university in the states and the instructor is really professional on her videos, even tho you don't have the full set of ideas behind that course it still explains to you like you are kindergarten on a class. They also provide transcripts for you to read if you have time. I even learned Japanese with it. Well my recommendation from choosing a course is something you really love and like. I happened to choose a course on my college days and ended up not liking it. So better look for the one that will totally make you grind for more.
@UnbreakableBloke	I took up business courses in Coursera, most especially in project management. Today, I am now a project manager for two marketing agencies in the US. Coursera helps me to finally use my knowledge I learned in that platform in my role.
@zaidalmashan517	That's great!! congrats. What is the best Project management course at coursera which will make me understand everything about PM?
@UnbreakableBloke	 @RichardWalls  As a digital marketer, I just realized I needed to know more about project management since they go well together. So, I decided to learn more about it. I started leading projects but I didn’t have the title. I applied last year and my different clients were impressed by my experience and credentials and decided to give me the project manager role in their companies.\n\nCoursera helped me advance my career. ️
@UnbreakableBloke	 @zaidalmashan517  I love UC-Irvine’s project management courses. They’re straightforward and they helped me to be equipped in my role.
@lih1352	Do you have a degree besides a Coursera certificate?
@gw7817	This comment made my day
@greateststam1	This is the first of very few comments that have confirmed a career gain from coursera.  Most of them are either flexing on completing a bunch of courses or raving about how great they are without saying anything about actually getting a job from it.  Hopefully your not just a bot.
@RogerClubv	I just started on coursera last week and I can't believe that I didn't do so earlier. I think the contents are put together much better and nore professional than Udemy.  I give it a 5 .
@Crimeshirts	Yup am wanting to do a bunch of courses on coursera. The good thing...is it’s free unless you are wanting their certificates.
@12823matthewkao	most important thing is that the certificates are recognized by most of the employers...its the real thing!
@antinorum9820	Same. I tried Edx and has been a nightmare.
@missloved8213	Do you still recommend Coursera?
@tng2138	Same, I completed a course from Bocconi and it was the first online course ever, that I enjoyed from the beginning. It motivates you and they do a great job on explaining topics to someone with few or no prior knowledge.
@trappedcat3615	Most comments read like paid reviews :/\nThe channel response to all the high positive reviews gives it a way
@andyc9902	Yes
@jaimesmith1086	 @RichardWalls  The Collab video would be awesome.
@justinrogers9010	I have 0 self confidence and have never taken anything beyond high school.  I know I know, that's crazy!  After seeing what this online course is all about and currently in a mid-life crisis, I want to try at least one course.  I'd like to have a certificate in something...I was actually looking at the Cyber Security course and may take the plunge....Thanks for the helpful information.
@dhruboisgood	All the best! Hope you plunge into that course and complete it.
@barnes80	You can do it!
@ijn1216	Do it! You deserve it for yourself. Imagine getting that Cyber security cert now. It will Change your life. Good luck to you ️ you got this!
@hirwa.emmanuel	Thanks for this reflection, coursera certificates really add value in career advancement, another important element that distinguish coursera with other learning platforms is financial aid option.
@jessicagideon9940	How do you get the certificate in Coursera?
@Tech-nicallyBlack	Some certifications give you credit hours, now there are degrees and masters on the website. I’m in IT support, looking into cyber security analyst, and AZU’s computer science masters with a specialization in cybersecurity\n\nPS. I’m coming from a non tech background. I only know CSS, HTML and SPSS. I majored in Sociology at UVA. It’s very doable guys! Don’t give up, I love Coursera!
@Tech-nicallyBlack	 @RichardWalls  THANK YOU SO MUCH! I was definitely looking into it and received a few emails about it. I’ll definitely be checking it out.
@atharizki5507	Yes I love it too, I highly recommended to my friends using Coursera and pay for it
@kayseacamp	I'm currently a new pre-nursing student and plan on taking Coursera's anatomy and physiology course prior to actually enrolling in that course with my school so that I can frontload the knowledge I need so that when I actually take the course I can be as successful as possible. I'm super excited I came across Coursera.
@reijin999	I've been studying from MOOCs for years and always have come across Coursera (paying money for certain courses has turned me away), but now I am reconsidering and will be working on the equivalent of a doctorate and actually having something to show for it. I've wasted money over the years on superfluous things but have come to realize investing in education (outside of buying textbooks) is is well worth it.
@jonsnow416	Hi Richard. I was looking for the perfect review on Coursera and I am in the right place. Thank you for this video. I am starting classes on Coursera.
@efraflores2270	hi my friend! aftr 9 month have coursera has been helpfull for your interests?
@ScarrednCharred	Did it do anything for you?
@chawquee	Best review is trying by yourself .it is free
@crisgonc	Coursera is brilliant. All courses I have completed have supported me in my career.️
@torreto5391	can you please explain?
@alanlado1602	Taking Coursera courses has been the best thing that happened to me in the last 2 years.
@torreto5391	can you please elaborate? did it help you get a job?
@mtorres723	 @torreto5391  these dudes don’t wanna explain haha
@lih1352	 @torreto5391  I'm starting to believe they're dishonest :/
@MASpiroShadowWoods	I appreciate your review. I completed my first Coursera course just recently. Mine was available through the university where I work so it was free. I agree the peer-grading feedback was hit or miss. I did learn a lot from reading what other people turned in for assignments. And I personally tried to provide decent feedback. Some of the feedback was really thoughtful. Some was not even written in complete sentences! LOL! But I enjoyed the course a lot and will probably continue in the certification it is part of.
@yolow69	I lost an opportunity due to lack of experience in an area . I am now working on getting a certification to make myself more marketable! Thanks for your insight!
@SarAbraxas969	Coursera will give you skills but your BODY OF WORK is what will get you hired. You need a portfolio of work nowadays to stand out. Merely knowing and having the certificate is not enough. Start a Youtube Channel and/or website to showcase. your skills. This is a MUST.
@Aisi555	I've just finished the AWS IOT course.. it was not for beginner and fortunately i am familliar with AWS from last year. Some exercise was written in 2019 and as 2021 AWS has upgrading some services,  so after exercise 3 it is not meet the required upgraded version. But after all,  it is boosting my confidence for this pandemic era as coursera approved my financial aid.
@Aisi555	 @RichardWalls   not much to expect, but i switch to educational jobs as it is more demand during this pandemic
@KenSherman	I commend you on clarifying a little of the difference between the specialization and the courses.
@sylenyap2409	Thank you for making this video. I'm stuck between taking a payroll course(s) with Coursera or taking a course with CUNY. I live in NYC and the price point is a huge difference. I'm currently paying for my son's college tuition and was wondering if Coursera would be worth the money as I would like to further my knowledge in finance but don't want to waste money. I truly appreciate your honesty and thoroughness.
@Rebecca-qg8pb	I want to get a master degree in business administration and VFX and a specialization in software development and the fact that I don't have to go to a physical university and study both at the same time is amazing.
@shortnykee4643	Love this video  - I saw on the sight that it would be $39 a month and it’s about 10 hours per week in less than 6 months, just wanted to make sure if that was accurate and also if it’s a certain time frame when we complete the classes are we suppose to schedule the test for the certification itself or everything is all inclusive?
@shortnykee4643	 @RichardWalls  Okay Great ! Thank you so much for the response back  I really appreciate it !
@paulal3261	I've taken Cybersecurity in college and Coursera and Coursera was excellent! They explained everything in a way I could better understand. The free course is nothing but listening so making sure you takes notes is highly important to make sure you know you are learning & understanding the content. Highly recommend 
@mqmareq6248	Coursera is great, but most of the courses I have done there were built in such way that if you do not achieve 100% score, you probably can not read. Exception being e.g. Pavel Pevzner's Bioinformatics specialisation or the original 2012 version of the Probabilistic Graphical Models course (has been diluted and split into several courses now, so not sure about that one any more).\n\nIn this respect, I found MITx courses on edX  better (and I like edX UX significantly more as well - yes, this is subjective). In order to pass those, you have to understand the subject matter, apply it in a creative way to a problem you have never seen before - so you have to actually think as opposed to Coursera's norm of simple recall quizzes. The only problem of those MITx courses is that they run on extremely crazy schedules, so having full-time job and/or family makes it almost impossible to do them simply because of lack of time.
@AmpDad87	I’m debating on taking courses has anyone taken any and have been able to advance in their careers?  Has your employers or others recognized the education from Coursera
@rexxander6679	Thank you for doing this review it's very informative 
@TravisSmith-jb8wr	Udemy is better for learning Python and SQL.  Learn and retained next to nothing after 4 months of python and SQL on Coursera.  Udemy has better hands on so far.  Actually it is almost all hands on.  \n\nCurrently taking 100 days to code and SQL boot camps.
@anomad6314	I'm stopping at 5 - 6 specializations and 2-3 individual courses. The last 3 specializations will based on change management, transformation, and SQL. Should be done by the end of May.... has taken 3 months, but will hopefully be worth it.
@anomad6314	 @RichardWalls   Thank you. FYI Below is what's done so far... it's taken longer than expected... will finish with a SQL specialization this week:\n- Organizational Change and Culture for Adopting Google Cloud Specialization \n- Digital Transformation Using AI/ML with Google Cloud Specialization\n- Organizational Leadership in Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Specialization \n- Strategic Leadership: Impact, Change, and Decision-Making Specialization (40K words of notes!)\n- Influencing: Storytelling, Change Management and Governance Specialization \n- Removing Barriers to Change \n- Content Strategy for Professionals Specialization (Capstone to sort)\n- Health Information Technology Fundamentals\n- Designing the Future of Work (2hrs left)\n- Digital Transformation \n- Digital Business Models
@dubrovniko	What a great video! Thank you Richard 
@CatherineChaw312	Hi there!\nSo I study using Coursera. I have taken a few courses on variety of fields I am interested in. I did an introductory marketing course ( from Wharton) and currently doing an accounting course ( also from Wharton). I wanna learn more about different branches of business as I am still trying to figure out what I like the most and what I should choose to pursue my degree. Now I wanna learn about business administration .Can you recommend me some great courses about business management or business administration for newbies on Coursera?\nThank you 
@tf4268	@RichardWalls My company gives us access to the Coursera+ classes, some of which are taken straight from the UIUC iMBA courses. From what I could see, if you take these courses ahead of enrolling in the iMBA, you can use them towards your degree. Having been a part of both Coursera and iMBA at UIUC, do you know if this is an additional way to save some $$ on the 12 or so credits I currently have access to? Or is it something that you inevitably have to pay for when transferring those credits for consideration/grades? Thanks man, great channel! UIUC and Boston University applications going in this week, in large part thanks to your content!
@dngt90X	Its free if you live in california and are part of public library system
@ShawnMKouri	Do they have due dates on the NBA courses for assignments? I’m at a community college and the professors set due dates for assignments. And sometimes we get 1 to 2 chapters per week. Well, really an average of one chapter. Plus of midterm if that happens depending on the professor and sometimes on rarer cases a final exam. What is Coursera like?
@sadinosecleticos	Awesome video!\nI am actually thinking about doing a course about Legal Tech and Startups!\nThanks!\nCheers 
@thatonedog819	I'm planning on using it to refresh my memory on some classes before going back to college after a couple year break
@i-xanity-i5136	As a person with no degree but interested in cyber security, would completing cyber security related certificates/courses allow me to step into the job field on a mid-high skill level?
@unknownzzz2200	I’m on the same thing
@lih1352	Wondering too. My husband believes some videos encouraging to obtain a cyber security certificate claiming you'll be making six figures to start...I say highly unlikely but would like opinions
@nidasyed7114	Hi, i just wanna know is it like online class or they have videos so that we can watch and learn anytime.. please do reply much needed
@KarenMoore-k3o	Right now im doing project management and trying to figure out which should be my next
@shahaijaz6576	What if we complete the 4 week specialisation in only one week. Can we download the certificate only after 1 week? Or do we have to wait for 4 weeks?
@shahaijaz6576	 @RichardWalls  Thankyou for answering my query. ️️️
@mohamed.nasser22	Thanks bro  i love to tell you that your channel will grow very fast i promise you
@torreto5391	my question abou the certificates is are they considered as real ones in the job market or just a self development thing you can use to just boost your chance a bit?
@torreto5391	 @RichardWalls  thank you! I appreciate the honesty man. You get a subscribe for that🫡
@Btheonly33	 @torreto5391  wouldn't say full honesty I'm waiting for him to talk about how they sell it as free but you can't get any certificates In the trial version.
@Brucee_97	I love it. Thank you for this review 
@stingyblue8189	What do you think about Forage’s courses for college students trying to figure out a career path and how does it compare to Coursera?
@joshuamizal2703	Thanks for you insights on this 
@omaymaajouamai5631	I would really like to know if you think it'll be possible to get into the job field of management using Coursera content, knowing that I have no degree. Thank youuu
@OliviaSmithR	Great content. What do you think about Vonza platform?
@OliviaSmithR	 @RichardWalls  Thank you for looking into Vonza
@OliviaSmithR	 @RichardWalls  thank you!
@BCM222	"Can one put these on a resume and get a job for example Comptia + and Security + certs and get a job are they accepted by most employers or are these ""decorative wallpaper"" like a continuation learning which is nice and all lets employers know you seek improvement."
@biggboi1025	You have to sell yourself in the interview. Mention to the hiring manager all the skills you learned, and even get technical with it.\n\nUltimately, employers don't care about school. Just that you know how to do their job.
@itsoyadoyinpalace6278	I’m in college for bachelors in cyber security, but I want to do IT or project management while still in college  in coursera would that make sense? Or be worth it ?
@bilalqasmi9907	I'm an Electrical and Electronics Engineer. I want to persue career in Cyber Security of Microsoft Certification. What will be the cost all in all? I've researched and found out $49/month. How it'll be calculated if I finish in 3 months or in 6 months?
@richardcontell1314	Hi Richard, \nOne question: If I complete for example a financial accounting certificate from Penn University, do I get the certificate from Penn University or from Coursera?\nThanks
@richardcontell1314	 @RichardWalls  Thanks, but will the certificate show I completed the course from Penn University?
@ariadnabeneventi7343	 @richardcontell1314  yup, but it does not counts as a Credit, unless the course says so. I did a course from yale about psych and it has the yale logo and the coursera as well. It says you completed a xourse from that uni from coursera, your name and the teachers signature
@katbutnohat_	I just did Microsoft Azure Fundamentals and it was riddled with problems. \nBroken links to Azure sandbox environments, steps that mention non-existent settings, or are in a different place now, inconsistent video player functionality from lesson to lesson - some fullscreen, some don't, some you can change speed, some you can't. And mid video tests that cut the presenter off mid-sentence and pop up before the fact have been taught. The whole experience was infuriating. Are their other courses falling out of sync like this, or was this just really bad luck?
@diceflawless9115	Is it self paced classes or do they have actual online class rooms?
@LilGamingChannel	well put video, thanks!
@FryedSaw	Greetings and Salutations \n\nFrom the free course offered in \nNew California Republic 
@TotalRookie_LV	"Tried one course - Python programming basics. It was a lot of ""water"" in what seemed to be like an intro to an actual course, but then there was a ""test"", which one had to pass to get further. I was extremely frustrated to put it mildly, seems like the aim of such ""test"" is not to test ones knowledge, but with how much BS one is willing to put up with.\nUser interface isn't brilliant either - here on YouTube you can use fast backward and forward, if you missed something, on Coursera it just isn't there. I don't remember anymore, what other issues with UI there was, but I recall myself thinking how ironic it is to have those for a site, which claims to teach web design and programming skills."
@Loofy101	Bruh. Why is the video slowed down. You don't sound normal unless at 1.25x or higher.

@infernalmochi7416	Hi, just a quick question. \nFor ANY free course they offer, you can get a paid certificate in the end? \nSo all of the process is free, but if you want a certificate to prove you've completed the course, you have the option to get a paid certificate?

@galactusisapuss	"I'm interested but I don't see how people whom have been high school drop outs can now attend Berkley. My question is say I use coursera and I get my B.A in computer science and I apply to IBM London, and the recruiter sees I've got a b.a from Harvard University. He decides to check with the dean of Harvard to make sure I've graduated from there. Is that dean or registrar office going to say ""hey, yeah he graduated from here I can see him in our program"". Or will they not have any information of me ever using there services."
@vijayrao5441	1. does it has weight in the course, 2-- will they help us get job, 3 how will be course conduct via zoom link, 4-- what type of job will i get, 5 after completing do we get job anywhere --   Salary how much i get ?\nthank u
@TR-vh1fi	 @RichardWalls  :)
@Moodboard39	No, is just a certificate. You add that into your resume and hunt for jobs lol duhh!! Good luck, because it's competitive as well . \n\nYou gotta have experience. Entry level , with low pay .
@MichaelWilliams-lo3ix	Thanks for this
@mercedesrivera590	Cuestión si I can take more then one course for same price ?
@simonlinser8286	i can't believe the amount of courses you guys are saying you take. is this average? is this necessary to remain competitive for your fields? i often try to learn things on my own, but i haven't been able to use one of these services. i would like to bring myself to the level that i have real certifications or other things i can use to get a job. but sometimes i wonder if it's worth it or that what really  counts is real experience. is it possible to move into a new career with one of these certificates? is this similar to actual college courses? the price is not extremely cheap and i wouldn't expect it to be if this is legit, but i don't even have a computer set up at the moment and i question whether or not it will be worth it in the long run.
@VivekSingh-ik5tv	It is not just about certifications but also knowledge delivered in a structured and bit sized manner which sticks with you if you do the courses correctly and with patience. Certifications are the proof that yes you have the drive to upskill yourself in the field of your interest. It shows your own drive to improve yourself to be a better version of you.
@blessingmatiro9082	Which IoT courses did you take?
@blessingmatiro9082	 @RichardWalls  Thank you so much, for getting back to me Richard Walls. This is definitely a great starting point for me. I will take this course, and I see that I can enroll today. I appreciate the career development and finance mentoring you offer, it's awesome! I was particularly interested in your journey to becoming a product manager especially in the IoT space (I am working for a tech company that develops software for IoT spaces) . I aspire to be a product manager soon, and I'm working towards it. Thanks for the guidance. I have my eye on a couple of online MBAs to consider, thanks to your video on that... Brilliant!! I am grateful.\nAny thoughts regarding working towards a Product management certification? Is this worth pursuing, and could you please recommend a great certification that is recognized internationally?  Many thanks!

@Carter878	Thank you for sharing your opinion, Daniel.
@Travis77Wallace	Daniel, I appreciate your review of Coursera. Can you make a comparison video with other programming platforms? There are many of them and it's getting tough to choose.
@diannemary8411	Hai,appreciate your vd,but may I ask if I learn from coursera the subjects that I didn’t learn during diploma,n can I know if the credits can be transfer when I study for degree?
@taha.elkasimi	You don't lose access to courses after the end of subscription and you can Audit courses for free
@CameronWright-nj1zc	Thanks, Daniel
@mScott-wr7ym	Coursera is extremely popular these days. Thanks for video
@elidahkimani4269	I was kinda sceptical but now I am mmmh thinking maybe I should give it a shot, furthermore it's just $50 a month
@SmooveQ50	Great review I have been using Coursera for almost 6 months now it does have some great Courses & I believe it is worth the price.
@Lala-xq2ht	Do you get certificate from it
@SmooveQ50	 @Lala-xq2ht   yeah it depends on what courses you’re looking to take but keep in mind just because you have a certificate it doesn’t guarantee you a job
@AaronB-qg8km	I took 3 courses from coursera and graduated with two certificates. Nice platform. recommend
@Colton_Peterson33	I just started on coursera last month and I can't believe that I didn't do it earlier
@Ethan_M77	coursera is the best! I found out about this platform because of you
@clivetaruvinga2815	Is it still good bro?...I heard when you try and get your certificate they keep on charging you extra and you don't find anyone to review your projects
@AustinB3234	great video! I learn Coding on Coursera only
@Asher-nx8mk	you are wrong man! some of coursera certificates really add value

@Cameron_Davis	Are Udemy's certificates considered as real?
@colincortes5352	I like that Coursera has lots of advanced lvl courses especially in data science
@arissasolis8494	for me Udemy is better for learning Python and SQL
@adamagresta1515	Coursera is brilliant. Like it
@JaydenB-qe3gm	any good webdev courses on coursera?
@Sullivan7685	Coursera is a bit expensive, but it worth it
@Wyatt_Coleman	I think the content on Coursera is much better than on Udemy.
@1xm_mx1	I tried out udemy - I like the fact that they have an automatic course progress tracking and gives you a certificate right away as soon as you finish the course.
@michaelmwanza8724	Udemy was  good for getting my feet wet in software development. Their rating systems help you choose the best courses. Their prices are very reasonable.
@RedSon_7	 @gradehacker  bro did u know whats going on in 2024 2 years prior
@DilshadDilliwala	Oh my God!! I am the first person to comment on this video. \nThis video is loaded with important information yet very few views and no comment on this. Info on EdX was new for me. Thanks for uploading this video.
@geekatari4391	"What I don't like of LinkedIn Learning is that their Learning Paths sometimes feel disjointed, especially when it comes to web development or any other programming language, which they also have but a handful of them. They start with the fundamentals, but the next course, although it progresses on what you learned, it is not related, nor it develops upon the previous course. \nIn contrast, Udemy has bootcamps and they start from the fundamentals and build up from there, following a path that is engaging. \nIt is still very good quality material (LL), and I would absolutely recommend it if it were cheaper, but sadly they want you to pay for all the LinkedIn premium ""advantages"" you may never need just to unlock the learning experience."
@pwyll63627	LinkedIn Learning is free if you have a library card or enrolled in post-secondary institutions (in canada atleast)
@wowpaintingadelaide	We found skillshare to be youtube tutorials but piad. Coursera or Udemy is the way to go.

@UtilisateuruetasilitU	I hate coursera i paid a yearly subscription and i regret it
@abdulsalamumarbarambu6371	Udemy and Skill share certificates are not recognized.
@zenzen2803	You should have mentioned the Financial Aid availability on Coursera
@CorentinKaiserITKaisergruber	I think you forgot to say that udemy courses are regularly on sale at 80% so they cost less than 20$ for a lifetime accès thats huge différence
@ihtesham_emon	This is the most information rich video on YouTube about the comparison of different learning platforms. And yet it has so few views! 
@adeelahsan___	Agreed 
@jamesfauzan4246	Gonna give skillshare & edX a try.. thanks for including the prices
@dameanvil	0:00  Consider online learning platforms if you lack time or funds for traditional college.\n0:46  Coursera: Offers diverse academic courses with affordable options, including programs from prestigious universities like Yale and Google.\n2:31  Skillshare: Subscription-based platform with a wide range of creative courses, though lacking official certificates or university-level programs.\n  Udemy: Provides a vast repository of specialized courses with lifetime access after a one-time payment and a 30-day refund policy.\n  EdX: Offers free access to high-quality courses from top universities, with optional paid certificates recognized for college credit.\n  LinkedIn Learning: Subscription-based platform focusing on professional development, particularly beneficial for business-related skills and networking.

@SuperHalo78	Ty! I'm interested in udemy but I have a full time job. Do you get graded and are you committing to taking proctorerd tests or teacher check-ins?
@ROcaStuff	No you don't get check-ins , you just have to go trough all the videos and you will get a certificate, you don't have a time limit so once you buy a course you can finish it when you can.
@SuperHalo78	 @ROcaStuff  ok , thank you so much!

@kareer4genz	Regularly I use Udemy for paid courses but these are knowledge based Solid realtime tricks does not cover in it. Coureera is little tricky where few topics are moderate & other high end certification are high price.

@chrismundanchery4357	It's just a marketing strategy. Udemy is quite frankly one of the lowest quality MOOC providers. Coursera ad Edx are easily the best since they're courses are affiliated with actual universities.

@Andbhaktkabap1	Edx is worst.....my favourite is Coursera
@nachoruiz7871	Nah, just are created for different people. I have tried both, and I can admit that edX is more damanding than Coursera and hence, more tedious. Sometimes, their assignments forces you to think out of the box. In other words, they force you to interiorize the knowledge by hart. However, Coursera is more of a guided path towards a very simplified and  narrow goal. To provide an example, the Harvard professional certificate at edX for Data Science takes more than a year to complete. The similar ones (IBM) at coursera take less than a year. This just reflects the point that edX offers a more broad preparation while Coursera reduces the content to increase learning speed. I am not saying that one is better than the other, they are just simply created for a different audience.
@seandabrowski1445	Yuck.
@pygmalioninvenus6057	I want short low quality courses that are very expensive. Who do I choose? Please help!
@loseweightfaster7813	You think learn something on courseras can guarantee you a job
@Tessa-Morgan	Which would be best for b learning a new language
@BigLoser84	thx
@ajramirez77	I used the Google cybersecurity certificate to prepare me for Security +. It served it's purpose. I ended up landing a job as a network tech for a gov contractor.
@henryijeoma	you got a job with literally just sec+?
@ajramirez77	@henryijeoma  In the US, if you want to work for the government, you're going to need Security + to work in IT. You need a cert that satisfies DoD 8570 IAT Level II and Sec+ does just that. My employer assessed that I'd be a good fit as a network tech then move me to their SOC after I learn their system. Starting pay is 68k.
@sattineez	I did it to, just hope I can also land a job after doing CS50 and offsec Pentestes exames 
@sarahanderson6913	 @ajramirez77   Thank You for Sharing!!!
@SmokeAlarmBeeps	@ajramirez77 What is your work experience, and what did the hiring manager say that was the reason you got hired?
@henryijeoma	 @ajramirez77  what is MS?
@ajramirez77	 @henryijeoma  Master's of Science. A graduate degree.
@brusslee1814	The fact that you actually took the course and completed it before giving your opinion says a lot.  +1sub
@infosec_mike	You do not need to take the course to know it's bullshit. But I am glad there is another professional out there speaking the truth.
@amanuelyaynu8333	 @JonGoodCyber So Which has a better quality cert if Google doesn't have? Thank you
@drehardin	"Almost none of them do. \nIt's crazy. They make money from ""clicks/likes"" and recycling other channels content."
@kippahthefrenchiewhippasni9689	 @drehardin  That’s the crazy YouTube now people copying each other. It’s a shame we can’t express our individuality when expressing our creativity………
@valerie.	same. I punched the sub button
@RonVik7	 @brusslee1814  yep\nAgreed. Subscribed
@Mack9077	I came in here just to say Google’s course is one of the main reasons I passed my Security+. I received a high score too. So if your planning on taking the Security+ take Googles course first
@ajramirez77	Same dude. Got a 784 on Sec+. I was able to switch from the mental health field to IT within 2 months after getting sec+. Now I'm working on getting CYSA+
@prostigeMarketing	 @ajramirez77 do you think it's better to go with Google over A+ before prepping for SEC+?
@ajramirez77	@prostigeMarketing  if the cyber course feels too hard start with A+. A+ will give building blocks for Sec+
@DPinWheel	 @ajramirez77  So what is the route you took to go from mental health to Cybersecurity. I’m looking to do the same thing. Could you help a brother out?
@allisonb9072	It is way better to complete the A+ certification. It will give you an excellent strong foundation. I took the Google IT support CERT to use to get into college, but I also passed my A+. In my opinion, after taking both certifications, the A+ is far better and will prepare you much much better especially if you were brand new to. IT\nThe CompTIA foundational certifications build on one another.
@OkTheOneWhoKnocks	 @ajramirez77  what did you do to study?
@jeffkan1	You had asked for us to comment on why we wanted to get into cyber security. I'm a former software developer, roughly from 1991 - 2012 ... as you can tell, I'm on the older side of people thinking of this industry, and I am very interested in the cyber security career. I was studying about a year ago for the Security+ certification, and convinced myself that having that on my resume would not be enough to get my foot in the door, and did not take the exam. Now, I'm ready to spend some money and try to get that door opened, even though I have a '6' in the first digit of my age. 
@jeffkan1	 @JonGoodCyber  good question! Doesn't have to be me building things ... I'd be happy doing the defense. That said, I will look at the roadmap and the App Security and Cloud. Big thank you to you, Jon! 
@ahnana833	You are young! Gogogo !
@NarendraMnr	I've almost completed it, currently at the end of 7th course (Python). \nI've had a exposure to Linux before. Just like you said, Except python (course 7) most of the Google cyber security course doesn't focus  or show or teach on actual applications that we'd use. \nBut what i CAN say is i'd rather have this than having aimlessly looking around without direction. and it did and DOES help me get confidence to go further. I just view it as first step, that's all.
@Alpha1CA	 @JonGoodCyber  where can I find your ebook?
@Crog2	My vote is clearly  for Google Cybersecurity Certificate ... and nobody paid me for that :)\nExplanation: in my opinion Google Cybersecurity Certificate is actually good as an entry-level training.  Outside of US, Comptia Security+ isn't that popular and highly demanded. In my country  Google certificate training costs 14$ (still cheap in US -  49$/month less expensive what Sec+ costs, 400$) and you get comparable knowledge as Security+  . In fact,  Google Cybersec has hands-on which Security+ doesn't.  This is a huge plus for Google certificate. We can discuss how in-depth or not those hands-on are, but  hey, this is entry level cert.
@Crog2	" @JonGoodCyber   ""you will never convince me of any significant value in certifications that employers don't list in job postings"" -   well, yes, it's new one.  Only time will show.\n""That means if you do not get hands-on experience,"" -  a big majority of Sec+ certified folks have just done video course +  probably have read book + practice exams. That applied to 95+% as reddit comtpia's channel and discord channel have demostrated. Sad but true. You're talking about ideal approach of Sec+ certification which included labs which will cost  extra 100-200$ and only small percentage of people want to pay for it. While Security+ is only multiple choice + PBQs it's essentially  still purely theoretic exam."
@WealthUko	The Google Cybersecurity training offered in partnership with Coursera is one of the best and affordable beginner level certification. I think your review primarily based on your expertise, ignoring this training was ment for absolute beginners. I also noticed your replies of comments here are directing viewers to your online course platform, this in my opinion also contributed to your bias review. Honestly I'm enjoying the content. Again I will like you to show proof of completing the whole course in 4 days because I'm battling this for some months now. Thank you.
@ZiangSecurity	i have done this in 3.5 days. I can give you proof :) I enrolled last Fri, Sep 27, 6:58 AM and finished Mon, Sep 30, 11:51 AM. Those dates I copy pasted from the email I got when I enrolled and when I receive the congratulatory email on my last course.\n\nUnfortunately I have to pay for certificate which I thought I will not have to :)
@CajunCarpenter	I am actually currently taking the Google Cyber security course I'm on the third one which I guess would be course 3... Anyway I greatly appreciate your honest opinion because now I think I should probably lean more towards going ahead and studying for the security plus instead. I can put my valuable money and efforts into that which will get me further than this one would. Again I greatly appreciate your brutal honest opinion and it's helped me see which way I need to go. Thank you sir.
@stevealami	It’s the perfect entry level cert as it is one of the only entry level certs that actually involves significant hands on experience
@stevealami	 @JonGoodCyber  not sure I agree . I deliver bootcamps for Cyber learners with no prior experience in the UK and I can’t think of a better qual for this level of learner. It boils down to where the learners are at .
@VicMansaMusa	I agree, one can get this Cert spending very few $ then build from there.
@Phanabot	Your review is 100% true! When I reviewed the course outline, I was quite surprised that they had SQL and Python as part of their curriculum. While those are nice to have, it's overwhelming for any beginner. Thanks for the real, and honest review. 
@Ameion	I have been looking for jobs and there are soooooo many jobs in IT that require SQL in my area, like a lot!
@Phanabot	 @Ameion  Interesting! I hadn't seen SQL as a requirement yet. Python maybe, but mostly for more advanced positions to automate.
@Chase10995	⁠ @JonGoodCyber What are these things that large percentage of jobs are asking for?
@deebee201	Yes, you should have some serious understanding of how networks work before taking this class, I got my Network+ and took a CCNA class before taking this cert course. I thought this course was amazing, it taught me a lot. Don't knock it. It is so much better than most of the cybersecurity courses out there.
@egrafting	Interested in google courses on Coursera in general and cyber secruity was one that seemed to be pushed quite a lot, so seeing your truthful evaluation on it is extremely helpful. Thanks Jon you did good :)
@ssboxer	I’m in course seven and everything you said in on par with my experience thus far. I would have enjoyed more in depth analysis of packets but I’ll have to get that from Chris Greer vids. At this point I’m just gonna finish it. It was something to do during summer so my interests wouldn’t wane. Now that classes have resumed it’s an afterthought compared to my college courses.  Thanks for your valuable insight.
@bosh9244	Currently half way through the course on the Linux portion. I have been enjoying the amount of knowlegdge i'm soaking in based on this whole course. This for me was the best way to introduce myself in the field as i'm currentlly working in help desk for about 1.5 yeears and looking for the next step. I'm definetly looking forward to using the sec + voucher especially since my employer agreed to pay for the exam with the voucher once I complete this certificate. I am already prepard to study for the 601 after I finish this course. Any advice on what I should be doing now as im going through the course or even after completetion besides taking the sec+ ?
@ajaobabajide5558	I am new to the tech world , and I have so much interest in Cyber Security. Is it ideal for me to start with Coursera ? Please I need urgent help
@TerryJulianLive	man thats ridiculous..most people do help desk for 6 months..max..you did it for way too long..
@The.Truth13	 @TerryJulianLive ehh that’s fine tho he done picked up all that experience it’s like the back of his hand. Not everybody climbing the oak vine as fast as possible we runnin this bag up regardless like chill w the criticism.
@plugmenace8513	What help desk job do you have? Did you get it with no experience?
@Leslie-zn9ly	 @TerryJulianLive hey a job is job nothing ridiculous about that. It all depends on if you have plans/goal. What you expect & works for you might not work for others.
@Leslie-zn9ly	I would recommend doing some research, be sure to chk their reviews.   Also Compare courses & prices before signing up. There’s some that have really good deals while others charge $800 more than the avg rate. Rn almost all prep courses have the same syllabus.
@TylerFernandes94	i've seen ads for these a bunch of times and I've been in a situation where I can do a career change if I wanted to, and I have a slight curiosity in doing cybersecurity. I searched up the course and then decided to check out reviews and looked at yours first because of the ONLY UNSPONSORED in the title. I was totally about to put down some money to do the course up until now. Thanks!
@jayvet8402	Josh when are you going to start posting again would love to hear updates on both your courses and the outlook and what jobs to look out for with cuts occurring in certain areas and for people transitioning from a non tech job.
@calisthenicarts312	It would be a waste of time, when can use your time to work on certs that maximizes your opportunity for job and skills.
@rcvargas26	 @JonGoodCyber  I know 2 people who stop because they realized they weren't that interested in cybersecurity as they thought.  Lets not forget a lot of people have misconception of cybersecurity because they realize how much Hollywood has embellish on the field.
@edmondgab	Josh still waiting on your next video!!!\nHopefully it’s on the Microsoft cybersecurity professional certificate
@SethFX	So a beginners course is basic, omg I never excepted that
@luiytheninja3655	ikr? lmao.
@maleekpate6770	Lmaooo
@EvilWeiRamirez	I started taking the course.  It seemed like a good primer.\n\nI'm doing it on weekends and using my weeknights to learn stuff on try hack me.  I really like learning in parallel like this.  I also enjoy the bite size pieces from thm.\n\nI'm hoping that this can be the beginning to a career, but I'm only done with course 4, so halfway through, and I'm going through the junior soc rooms at thm.\n\nIt's pretty fun though.
@seunalomasojo4957	Hi I’ve got some issues on my thm excercies I don’t know if you can put me through pls..
@kidthorazine	I to the MS security course and the google one, the MS one covers a lot of the same ground but also feels super marketing heavy this time with a focus on Azure/AD and other MS products, but it does sort of go through Azure/AD 101 which is very important and something that the google course skips over completely.
@N3bulaInsomniac	I've started the Cybersecurity course, had to take a break due to personal reasons, but I am hoping to finish it soon.\n\nFrom what I have seen in it, it's fairly good. Although I have no cybersec background. Maybe this video isn't sponsored by Google but seems like it's affiliated with a course that is a direct competitor. \n\nI think lots of people think this is an ALL IN ONE cert, although it says in the description that it was built alongside CompTIA as an intro for people with no background and want to take the security+ cert. which is the main reason I am taking this one just to get BASIC knowledge so that I can take that, along with other studying, and attempt security+. (also apparently you get a discount for it lol) \n\nI will hopefully be back shortly with an update once I finish the course :D
@sarahanderson6913	Thanks for your honest review! I'm taking the IT support cert and plan on taking the Cybersecurity one as well. Just to help prepare for the Sec+.
@azael1633	Moving from software engineering to cybersecurity so I looked into this cert and found your video. Thank you for going out of the way to look into this cert and complete it yourself! +1 sub from me. def will check your other videos. Mad respect for the unbiased opinion
@ConsciousFella	This was the most honest review I've come across thank you
@RADIUMGLASS	WATCH THE ENTIRE REVIEW. Finally a good and direct review. Windows is not getting phased out anytime during my lifetime. There needs to be major focus on Windows.
@qaidahmed5624	What annoys me is that some people who have zero knowledge in IT  and cybersecurity, want to land a job within 3 to 6 months, most even don't bother working in the technical skills related to the cybersecurity path they want to pursue.
@EJNJLogisticsLLC	Hey Joh.  How are you?  What apps, bootcamps, websites and/or tools would you recommend for a beginner?
@MegaGuapo97	The value of this cert or any form of knowledge depends on your goal.  If your goal is to get a job in security, the probability of doing that solely by completing a cert that takes a relatively short amount to complete is minimal.  However, if you're looking for a base level of knowledge to build upon or if you're not certain security is right for you, the Google cert is fantastic.  It's just not magic.
@AndrewTateMotivation5	Thank you for the honest review..I have a question?\nQ: what course or study do u recommend that’s gonna make u “from no knowledge of IT to a cybersecurity professional”?
@calisthenicarts312	Got my attention now.  So many cybersecurity experts on here, it's good to identify someone who is straight forward and doesn't blow smoke.  Appreciate your honest review!!!
@calisthenicarts312	 @JonGoodCyber  For those on the outside, it's a little harder to determine.
@thegamer340	if a person already did that course, what would you recommend they do afterwards, also lets say a person already found a job in that field, would you still recommend other type of education to follow up on?
@DynamicTech.t	I appreciate your feed back on this material and from scanning over some of the content agree with you.  Thank You.
@NazvarTV	So from where would you suggest to start if Google Cybersecurity Certificate is bad ? I'm 35y and i want to change my career to Cybersecurity ( i have 0 knowledge about it ). What's the steps i should to take to end up with a job in Cybersecurity ? Thank you
@brennenmcminn2387	I already passed my sec+ over a year and a half ago. I'm using this as a refresher course to go back over material I haven't looked at in awhile.
@Todd-yv7qm	My issue with it, normally buy the instructors study guide and take notes inside the book. Only in section 1, I seem to be writting everything down. The best part is the readings.
@demonsinmysemon	Man, i just graduated with my bachelor's degree in cyber security (miami) and i started studying for my security+ 601. I started google cyber security professional cert because i felt school didnt teach me anything and now im at my witts end about what to do. I just want a decent entry level job to learn what i was actually learning to love.
@demonsinmysemon	 @JonGoodCyber  thanks a lot for that! I know a good amount of theory but if I was to get a job tomorrow I wouldn't know what the heck to do.
@Matt-jc2ml	Yeah cybersecurity is kinda a pointless degree tbh. Most employers want certs and experience. You wouldve been better off with the A+ qnd help desk and get the network and sec+ while working. I'm getting a compsci degree but getting those certs just to keep my options open
@fercoshow	 @Matt-jc2ml  How do you feel now getting Compsci degree when no one can find a job with it?
@Matt-jc2ml	 @fercoshow  wouldn't say nobody can get a job with it, it's just harder. And it's still better than cyber security because you can just get a few hundred bucks worth of certs instead, and you'll still have to do helpdesk even with a degree
@DroptheBass9815	Thank you for the honest review! As someone who is new to the Cybersecurity field (I’m currently 3 courses deep into the Google Cert) I saw this very as a good way to get discounted access to the CompTIA Security + cert. In your opinion, does it seem worth it to complete the course or is that the sunk cost fallacy talking?
@RonVik7	I signed up after watching multiple cybersecurity professionals recommending this course as a first step towards cybersecurity career in order to see how you like it. Finished 1 course in 3 days, currently on 2 course.  I am gonna do a bootcamp at a local community college.
@lioncrud9096	6:30 minor correction that the 6 month estimate is based on 7 hours per week.  If one were to study 7 hours per day, that'd almost a full time job lol and they'd complete the course in about 3-4 weeks.
@zoltron30	My part time warehouse job at Fedex pays for courses so I took a 6 month Cyber Security course at a local college but felt that I didn't retain some of the info as I learn best with CBT based training. Full time I work for an ISP that is very Cisco (CCNA), Nokia (NRS1) and basic cloud centric but I would like to break into Cyber. Looking at taking this course then some hand-on ones like Hack the Box....
@samha1513	I did it in just 4 weeks with no prior  cybersecurity knowledge but although I did have some programming knowledge and I did like how they used Python. Everything was good for someone with little or no knowledge in the field but it does open doors to study for sec+
@JESS1CAC	I've actually learned more about cybersecurity from Google than from the bootcamp I attended. It's really helpful and resourceful.
@Godwlingua	Thank you for this video. Now, can you please make a video on the Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate?? I would like a to do a comparison. I have no IT skills. I plan on taking the Google cybersecurity certificate next month and make my way up to sec+, cisco cyberops, BTL1, Cysa+, Casp+, etc...you can notice I haven't mentioned anything about A+ or Network+. That's because I have been told the google cert would give me all the foundational network skills I need.  Also, the 30% voucher they offer for the sec+ is appealling.
@Shannon_Robbie	What online course/program do you recommend for beginners wanting to get into Cybersecurity?
@ultravioletiris6241	Thanks for this. You just gained a lot of respect from me for not parroting the typical marketing for this program
@ruggiero1206	 @JonGoodCyber   I’m new to cybersecurity looking to start a career as a SOC Analyst what online course would you recommend for somebody like me with no experience and working a full time job. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated
@notsammiguel8417	I’m 35 years old. I haven’t worked in 3 years because I was in a coma for 3 months back in 2021. I want to start a new career in technology. Will Coursera be good for me?
@TechTualChatter	I agree. I tried to keep my review as honest as possible for people just starting out in cyber \n\nHowever like you stated the lack of depth in areas and why windows wasn’t covered as it should have is a bigger issue. \n\nIt also didn’t make sense to me to mention the cissp to people who can’t qualify to take it lol\n\nGood video
@TechTualChatter	 @JonGoodCyber  yeah I think it was a good first attempt. I think the main issue is making it so broad. They should just have longer courses geared at different domains
@jeffreywitty3088	"IMHO, I'd START with getting your (similar in brackets):\nAt their cost, they are better value compared to ""practice"" exams packs\n1. Google IT Support (ITF+ > A+, some Net+/Sec+/Server+)\n2. Google Cybersecurity (Sec+, abit Net+)\n3. Google IT Support Automation (A+/Net+ some Server+ ++)\n4. Google Project Management (Pro+)\n\nFIRST (A more forgiving method of certification)\nThen get CompTIA equal certs (when YOU ARE ready)\n\nGoogle > Its a ""better entry"" , cheaper, more modern/accepted A+, Net+, Sec+, Pro+ > ""equal"" (give it 2 years they will be as standard as CompTIA)"
@CyberTronics	You legit guy. So many talk without actually taking the course!\n\nI tried the course but abandoned it, did not like it for many reasons. \n\nThanks for your honesty you earned a subscriber.
@WaqarKhan-mo3gg	So as someone who have zero knowledge and no background in computer science and wanted to learn cybersecurity what do you recommend where should he start from ?and what course he should start with to get all the basic ideas. NEED FOR SOME GUIDANCE
@curesnow6493	 @JonGoodCyber  I signed up for your newsletter, but I did not get your ebook.
@Sterbenys	Thanks for this, I’m currently on Course 3 & i feel like I’m haven’t really learned too much… just a bunch of definitions they’re cramming into my head. I also believe there’s no way this is “professional” it seems super basic knowledge, I do plan on further expanding my knowledge after it though. Perhaps a associates degree & there’s places near me that offer 11mon actual irl training hands on at this one base I might look into. I’m still enjoying it though because I’m 25 and just now realizing I enjoy tech a lot & want to do something in the industry & cyber really has me excited.
@kyshawntv6285	As a beginner, the course is perfect to get to your feet in cybersecurity at all. Just brings some light on the career path really. But if you already have basic knowledge and already have other certs, then the Google cert will be no use to you of course!
@kyshawntv6285	 @JonGoodCyber  Agreed cause To be honest, i am halfway through the course. And i am about to ditch it as well lol. I see what they mean. The first half of the course is great to learn terms and stuff, but after like course 5, they kinda do recaps on the previous courses and it’s all the same stuff now. Just said in different ways. \n\nWhat do you recommend i start next? I’m new to cybersecurity. But I’m not sure if i should start the comptia A+ or go straight for the security+. Also finishing the Google cyber cert for the 30% off on the security+ is the real reason why people even finish the course tbh. I just don’t like to waste time lol
@bryanreed316	I'm just past the halfway point and I'm just trying to get through it. It is boring but I do like the labs. Rather learn more hands on. But do the report labs actually matter in the real world?
@kyshawntv6285	 @JonGoodCyber Thank you! I’ve decided to stop at the python course. They are word dumping even more and it is difficult with the way they teach. And the labs for the python course suck because it’s not hands on. I would rather learn on my own with the actual program and YouTube vids on python and SQL. And yeah the discount voucher is really not worth it, I’ve got what i needed from the courses, because now they are just milking it lol. It was fun to learn before they started to repeat themselves. \n\nDecided to go back and do the comptTIA A+ and then the security+ certifications.
@sahilsvision	" @JonGoodCyber  ""How do I know people are quitting? The discussion forums are part of the requirements.."" Not really, you can skip it, I did it initially but skipped all the other ones and still doing the course. It's a great course. Is it going to land me a job? No, probably not. But i never expected it to."
@BibleSamurai	Alright, I kinda change my mind. I agree with you. Certificates are worthless unless it teaches you how to do the job vs just giving you a piece of paper like a liberal arts degree. However, anything is better that nothing and it shows employers your possible dedication to learning the trade. But nothing beats actually learning the trade and being obsessed with the craft vs just trying to get a job via a piece of paper alone.
@TyTheKazekage	Similar in how a lot of people see the CISSP a mile wide and an inch deep in content, but with this, I would say at best, this is only a half a inch deep. I will say for a person that is inquisitive, it left me wanting to learn more. Not going over Windows and AD is something I realized I should have learned before even being exposed a threat, vulnerability, or risk, incident response, wireshark, python ect. I always felt it should have been redone and behave like the BTL1 cert operates in being lab heavy in all their courses.
@wayfinder81	I treated the course as a general introduction to cybersecurity so that I could really confirm I held interest in pursuing it. I had very low expectations for the career group access or even getting any responses on their boards (which was dismal most of the time). But I do feel it served its purpose, and I finished it within about a month so I think I ended up paying the 50 bucks. Wasn't too bad.
@mikes_.5_cent	The one possible plus for the Google Cyber security is the Sec+ coucher.
@The_Egg_Studio	I took the IT fundamentals course provided by coursera as I don’t have any certificates yet I’ve been in my MSP lvl 1 tech role for a year and want to move on to a specialization i picked cybersecurity and have no idea which certs I should go with there being soc, sec, cissp, and all kinds of roles while I think if your an absolute beginner and no nothing about computer I do think the fundamentals is a good start as a supplement with studying for comptia a+ security+ or network and possibly a ccna.
@The_Egg_Studio	 @JonGoodCyber  I agree that there are a lot of entry level training courses/programs available I think there is a lot of not a very general or laid out path for specializations as there are tons and tons of different certifications. What are your thoughts on getting into cyber security and where would one start or should start?
@YukisomeVideo	Half way through the course. agree most things with you..would you review the microsoft one as well?
@artofkhaos2336	Agreed would love your take on the microsoft one as well.
@mikes_.5_cent	make that a 3 rd behind Yukisome and arto.
@amigazo3972	I share your point of view. I would say that this course is just an appetizer and will never guarantee you to land a job, unless a company is willing to continue training you.\nThis course is a foundational help to continue your learning journey. I decided to take the SOC path and with only the Google course nobody will give me a job.\nTons of knowledge and technical additional stuff are necessary to learn before even to think about an internship, for example.
@kervinaham7375	Well I think the google cyber certificate is one of the best as I have taken a A few months of this certs, it touched on thing other certs or courses never touched
@drazenlakic50	You mentioned it will take 6 months to complete if you study 7 hours per day. That sounds intimidating for a basic course. Did you mean per week?\nThank you for a detailed review!
@sirxbit	How long did it take you to finish the course?
@cybercam33	I really appreciate this candid review. I was thinking of taking this course as a refresher before diving into my Sec+ studies since I got a month of Coursera for $1. I'm thinking I'll apply that effort in another direction.
@bkstandard882	You really should. 30% off that expensive security + I'd you take it.
@cyberlocc	"Ya I took it as study material for the Sec+, he is being a little harsh and basing this review on ""you wont get a job with this alone"" which ya clearly, but as Security+ study material and some python, its great. \n\nThey also say to not take this without the other google certs that already teach windows and networking, so thats a large aspect of him saying this sucks, but he is ignoring that aspect. They assume knowledge from the other certs that they tell you to take first."
@samsonvladislav4167	Q: So what is a beginner to do if you're interested in cybersecurity? I see so many different sites advertising the same.It almost sounds like taking the A+ or the Regular Google IT support cert is the best way to start (before taking any security cert). Any thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated! 
@Bitcoin_Shango	As I mentioned earlier, your opinion is much appreciated  \n\nBut tbh most if the certs are just to get past the gatekeeper who usually know next to nothing about the job. \n\nSo long as they point us in the right direction for us to do some due diligence on our own & speak to the basics in an interview, it serves its purpose.
@SeeSaw99	"I've been researching a career change into cyber for a few weeks now and I've yet to encounter anyone knowledgeable and credible who's #1 sponsored or #2 hasn't demonstrated that they haven't taken any of the courses they're reviewing. After years in a certain area in the military, it's somewhat easy to spot a BSer fairly early in some of these videos. You mentioned that this cert belongs in the ""trash"" but I didn't catch your recommendation(s) as a better alternative to newbies looking to get started"
@SeeSaw99	@JonGoodCyber  OK. At first glance, and maybe I'm wrong, but it looks like you're selling something, which is probably why I didn't hear you mention any alternatives to the Google cert path. I'll take some time this weekend and go through your play lists. I'm trying to develop a plan to be prepared for a career change from transportation logistics into cyber by the end of Feb '24. Thanks for the reply
@MrReynoso	Q: Is there anything comparable or superior to the Google Cert for someome who wants a general introduction into Cybersecurity?
@MrReynoso	 @JonGoodCyber  yeah, the goal is to prepare myself to start learning skills to enter the field, but I am starting from scratch. I'll explore the ebook as well. Thank you.
@TheQA247	Thanks for this. I just finished the Sec+ training vid (Cert tbd). This GCP was next. I heard so much good out of it but this honest review saved me time and $$, 2 resources in short supply lately.
@NK-iw6rq	This course alone may not be able to land you a job right away but it will teach you a lot and give you a great foundation to get you started and is affordable. It helped me pass the Security+.
@NK-iw6rq	 @JonGoodCyber  Good point Mr.Good !
@kevinparker2314	Thank you for not selling out and telling us the truth.
@luisfigueroa8114	I appreciate your review. Q: if this is not worth it in your opinion, which route would you recommend?
@financiallyfocused8829	Geez finally a REAL review I thought it would never happen. Thank you 
@ricksongracie618	Is there something you would recommend instead?
@CyberStudies	Good evening Jon! Good video; I agree with you that there were a ton of reviews which had what felt like a layer of bias lol The Security+ discount is something worth mentioning but overall I agree with your points! Keep up the good work!
@LiquidChamploo	I chat GPT’d this course in my current role (Systems Administrator) and leveraged it for a raise. \nI’m currently studying for my CISSP but needed a little bonus on my yearly review lol
@Gem1421	Thanks Jon! I thought the same thing, when the clowns started pushing that certification. No employer is asking for that certification but they push it like it’s the best thing that ever came out. Since your doing this one how about doing simplelearn courses too. There is a YouTuber who says they are the top ten courses and certifications. I told her no employer ever ask or heard of that crap!. Thanks again
@ryan17stehle	I took and completed it only because you get a 30% discount for the Security+. It took me only 1 month and saved me roughly $100. Still needed alot of additional work though to study for the exam.
@ryan17stehle	 @JonGoodCyber  you're right it was the security+
@yejiz_nuts	HOW TO TAKE IT FOR FREE: Check with your library! My library has free access to Coursera, I wouldn't've been able to take the course without it!
@keletsoMatlalaBouy	"Where do you navigate that ""library"" ??"
@shaadd4591	So if you don’t have any type of knowledge about cybersecurity but interested in learning, where would you recommend starting?
@GameronLeave	This course isnt of any value in the job market but it’ll definitely help you test the water before diving into it.
@matchbox3eb	I will preface that i don't think this cert is a replacement for Security +. Sec + is the baseline cert to have. With that said.... While I appreciate your full review and take on this, I would have to disagree that it belongs in the trash. I think it's a fresh take on introducing the same tired material we all drone on. I do like that there are a variety of people offering their stories of getting into the industry as well as some descriptions of what they do in the field. Most trainings I've seen are just shotgun bootcamp style trainings to pass a test. There is a lack of hands on training for people that are just studying theory for certs. I also would say that while Python might not be a requirement, it is definitely a skill to level up from someone that is a monitor of a network. There's a wide variety of skills and focuses and I think the course has done a great job of introducing this material with very short courses so it's not overwhelming.
@enriquecsoto	So what course would you recommend? I have zero knowledge of anything related to cybersecurity but I want to start somewhere & I’m considering Coursera just because it’s something and not nothing and is priced relatively cheap.
@SheepdogTTV	If I already have security+ is this course still worth doing? Attempting to gain all the certs I can because I only hold an associates degree. My other option would be to obtain a BS.
@celestialbeing4767	Do you have a take on the Microsoft version?
@RamenEnjoyer404	I think google course serves it's role perfect. It won't land you a job, but it probably the best intro for a newbie in cybersecurity, and is good prep leading into the first real cert that holds some weight, sec+
@ChevansonThelusma	Yea I already knew most of the things that’s on this cert and I 100% don’t believe that you can’t get a job off this but I have to see for myself when ever my contract ends.
@mfishaa3503	I mean, if you finish in four days you didn’t actually go through the course you just skipped through all the lessons and videos, and then took the tests. How would you know if it’s a good course or not?
@andrewliguori7952	Would you recommend for someone who has not the slightest clue of anything cyber security
@khalidhoqoq	Hi Jon. I really appreciated your video. But as a novice who is trying to understand the mysteries of this incredible new world, I was under the impression that this Google Certificate would at least guide me in a direction. One thing that I would have appreciated is alternatives. If this certificate is not up to par with the industry's current standards, what pathways would you suggest for someone like me to begin learning and growing? I look forward to reading your response.
@khalidhoqoq	 @JonGoodCyber  Thank you, Jon, for your directions. I'll read your book tonight and continue to follow your newsletter as well.
@doma.7859	Hey Jon, I stumbled onto your channel as I’m trying to get validation for this course as I’m currently taking it. I’m about finishing up course 2 and  after watching your video I’m kind of second guessing on finishing off this program. \n\nQ: what is the preferred route to take for learning/studying? \n\nI was thinking of picking up a compTia network and security + at my local bookstore & learning  from there. I’m taking the google course only cause I’m new to the IT field and don’t know too much terms and how everything works but I’m willing to put in the time and effort to learn it. Also google cert helps prepare for the compTia sec+ exam all the more reasons I am taking this course. \n\nMuch mahalos,\n\nDom
@fadedchannel	I know my page is about fishing but my day job is in IT. I finished the course in 7 days. As a seasoned IT professional with over 20 + years of experience I used it as review and to get ready for the CompTIA Security + exam. I think it's a good course for beginners. Will you get a job after you complete it? It doesn't hurt to have it but you won't have people knocking down your door.
@chefbyardee1791	So what do you recommend for a beginner?
@karnaerrande	I took the course last month as someone with no cybersecurity experience. Now studying for my Security + attempt next week I'm finding that the Google Cybersecurity Professional course didn't help me at all while preparing for this exam. Also that voucher discount code for 30% off can be found online. Anyone considering the course: don't waste your time
@LTCEZIO	Im looking at taking a google cert or two but im new to the world of computers outsid eif basic use. Where should i start as I wanna get into the IT field.
@Glenningway	Thanks for your honesty.  Too many influencers hawk these courses and I'm glad you called it out.  Whenever someone shoves a course in my face, I click away from the video.
@khaho1756	6:35 small mistake, they say 7 hours a  WEEK not per day if you want to complete in 6 months
@jfisher164	Thank you for this review.  I was considering taking it just for the 30% off the voucher and additional knowledge. I have already taken a Sec+ instructor led class, just completed my A+ and Net+ but had to leave the program I was in and might not get a voucher. I’m also coming from 20 years in the military and having a tough time getting an “entry level” job for whatever reason.  Do you think in my case this would still be a waste of time?? I feel like I can bang it out in a week or two which would make the discounted voucher and extra experience worth it…or should I just knock the Sec+ out and roll the dice?  Either way, I need to get an IT job somewhere or this will all be for just personal knowledge haha
@jfisher164	 @JonGoodCyber  ah ok got it, and yea I’m new to IT. At the beginning of my career, I had a stint where I did networking with windows NT/2000 but that was A LONG time ago haha. I’m just trying to broaden my horizons to get my foot in the door but maybe just getting that Sec+ is the better choice. I figured I’d get a different perspective with the Google one, just to better my overall understanding. Net+ was hard as hell!
@jfisher164	 @JonGoodCyber  thanks man! I appreciate all that you do!
@jfisher164	 @JonGoodCyber  also, I’ve just decided to strike while the iron is hot. I’ve gotten the last two in less than a month, I can crush sec+ in the next few weeks.  Thanks again, subscribed!
@superboogen	This is why scrolling past the first few most popular videos is crucial .\n\nI guess ill take the stairs after all: a+, network+, security+, windows and linux, sql, python, java in some sort of  cohesive fashion snd keep looking at things not shiny amd flashey. \n\nBoy its gonna be kke short winter for me 
@Wesjapa100	You finished it on 17th Sep and I started it 2 days later. It took me a month to complete and it felt quite overwhelming to me because I was and still am completely new to Cybersecurity.\nIf you didn't like this course, you definitely don't like Coursera in general, because in my experience, the Google Courses are the most well-structured that I tried there. I started the IBM course before starting the Google one and it was really shitty: poor audio quality and very amateur PowerPoint presentations, for instance. \n\nOverall, I liked the course but I have been doing projects and trying other platforms because I feel like I keep forgetting most of the stuff. More than 8 or 9 months have passed since I started taking Cyber courses and I'm still lost and haven't landed my 1st job yet.
@Wesjapa100	 @JonGoodCyber  Thanks for your insights! )
@VanStubbs80	I took this course and finished it in 6 weeks thinking it would prepare me for the security + exam.  I then took a practice exam and was stumped. I don't see how anyone can pass that exam with this course alone.
@DeathSmoke187	What course would you recommend for starting in cyber security?
@myfunny39	I am a newbie wannabe in cyber security. Your video definitely tells a lot about google cyber security. Hope that google take you input seriously.\nMy question is. What is the difference between cyber security and a white hat hacker? Are they same or different. Can a cyber security analyst identify themselves as white hat hacker or vice versa? What knowledge differs them?
@myfunny39	 @JonGoodCyber 
@RepublicOfWesternCanadaNOW	I am just about to start the google course. I have the $1 black Friday coursera deal.\n\nI only have another 16 days on it though. \n\nI have zero knowledge of Cybersecurity but im looking for the best way to get started.
@AryanKumar-eq7vp	Hey I get the problems you listed here are quite substantial and worth taking in consideration while looking for a course as this one. Please recommend good courses at a reasonable price that get the job done.
@nilcataraja1459	O: I appreciate this video, coming from someone who is considering of  taking on this certification course. Thank you.  So my question is: what's your advise , which certification should someone take, if he or she is a total beginner?
@subhadramahanta452	It was very insightful, thanks a lot sir!\n\nI'm a noob, but still have rough idea, I did one bootcamp a few years back, eventually decided to not get into cybersecurity but here I am now..\n\nI'll probably read about the said information on my own and try to finish the Google certification as soon as possible and then get the security+ certificate..\n\nWill you call this an alright strategy?
@subhadramahanta452	 @JonGoodCyber  thanks a lot!!!
@phazercoretech6841	What should we take instead????
@playerunknown6728	Thanks for your unbiased view. I’m studying bsc cybersecurity, just completed my first ever semester and i feel like i’m getting robbed.
@adamp.8571	Great video! I’m currently starting out with Microsoft’s cybersecurity course. It sounds very similar to Google’s course but with an emphasis on Azure and Windows. In the video you mentioned how Google focused on Linux instead of Windows. Does Microsoft’s course holds more value than Google’s because of it?
@adamp.8571	 @JonGoodCyber  Yes, the Coursera one. I’m treating the Microsoft course as a building block towards towards Sec+ and getting a cloud cert. I have no expectations as far as landing a job once I finish the Microsoft cert. Thank you for taking the time to respond!
@boomknight1015	I've seen people tier list them. It ends up low to mid due to Sec + being the bread and butter of getting a job in sec and with google cert it's the new kid on the block that HR doesn't know that much about, let alone interviewers. If they don't know or trust it, then it's useless as a cert. The only bonus is you can finish it for free (If you can finish it in 7 days, $50 something a month, also a small discount off sec +, so I heard.)
@UrRealestCritic	Witch course should we go for then ? Witch certification should we get ?
@GoldPeakLLC	You completed the entire certificate in 4 days? Did I hear you right? If so how many hours per day?
@jamesbyrd3740	The content is better than sec+, but not as recognized.  You also get a discount for sec+. so it's a good idea to get both.
@pottergold4600	Look , as someone who has a professional certificate from an actual university and has obtained two college degrees, I am here to tell you that these professional certificates are just to get your foot in the door. These courses are there to give you core information and if Coursera has left anything out of the learning curve like, Windows and etc, then you will pick that up as you go. If you want everything covered in your certificate, you need to go to college and learn the science from ground up and all of that missing information can be learned there. Some peoples expectations are too high, 39.99$ a month is not tuition. It is a subscription fee for data and information that you may complete by a reputable and professional source though. I hope that helps moving forward.
@unicaller1	Python is great but I don't think I have ever seen a SOC1 position that requires it.  I am a strong believer that you should learn a programing language and Python is very common in security but not needed for many positions.
@nahidsarker69	So which certificate you recommend for a newbie who has no knowledge about cyber security and wants to prepare himself for Sec+???
@kanikia	Thank you for your honesty. I agree that comprehending Windows security is key in cybersecurity due to its widespread use. Glossing over essential aspects of Windows security is not ok! As a beginner transitioning into cybersecurity, I don't find it worthwhile to get the Google certificate. I think I will get the Sec+ and begin my practical, hands-on training.
@boost_bandit	hey there mr Jon Good. I am soon to be in my senior year of high school and my library offers the google cybersecurity cert. I was thinking about taking it over the summer.\n\nTLDR: do you think this course would be good to dip my toes in the water as a high schooler?
@CODA1993	Thanks for the honesty! I'm starting with some AWS certs an was thinking of doing this after for some extra knowledge..what would you recommend in addition to this to study for sec+?
@anatolisen	Fun fact. Chrome OS, is a Linux-based operating system developed and designed by Google
@acceptcookies3644	Google Technical Support Certificate deals with mostly windows but they also push the chrome OS as well. The google cybersecurity course helps with preparation for security+ and with the concept of Linux system, it is shown base on the fact that most pen testers use it for EH and windows is barely used for it.
@user-sangsangd1v	I earned my IT SUPPORT SPECIALIST CERTIFICATION.  Almost done with Data Analytics,  continues with cyber and other's.  Hope those steps helps me more . But rally don't like t see people comments , yeha short time this that .... maybe . But those people  learned anything on skills ? .... anyways.  !! Thanks mate
@speedytruck	8:46 That's a huge plus, IMO. Windows is a technical fail of an operating system. If there are businesses using Windows for their servers, they're already beyond repair (It's not like this is the case anyways because Linux and BSD servers are the overwhelming majority). And those businesses should also switch to Linux for their desktops as well. In Germany, SUSE Linux Desktop is widely adopted, and it's only going to get even more adoption into the future. So you should forget about all your Windows skills because that OS is going to become obsolete sooner or later especially with their new rumored subscription model for Windows 12.
@andypina4478	I like your honesty by conpleting 100% of each course.
@iCyberLee	Thank you for your nice review! I was thinking about to apply this course.\n\nI have Kali Linux, BlackArch and with most of the famous tools experiences and i also have my own lab to test out everything. \n\nI just need a certificate, so i will take a look into this course and i dont need any Kali training from this course, since i already have the skill. So this is def. good for me!
@iCyberLee	 @JonGoodCyber  Yeah true! Thanks for your answer & explanation. \n\nIn my country cant easily get into any IT- job without a actual education, even i have more then 10 years experience in IT- but they still rely on people who have education instead... Even i have done in my job are not enough for them to take me. \n\nWhen HR sees that i don't have education in IT- from a school. They will not take me. Even i have done real life job in IT- and helped to fix software issues with many companies and customers.\n\nI started to learn Cyber Security basics and IT- stuff since 2009. I got a phone repair and a customer service job since 2013 and also in that time i have done many IT- support for customers and after work i've learned more and more online. I also started iOS Jailbreaking since 2009 and i'm also familiar with terminal commands etc... because with Jailbroken iPhone, i have played a lot with terminal like installing package, remove, fix dpkg, SSH and file browsing etc...\n\nThere have many Cyber Security job in here which requirements are very simple (mostly have based IT- skills and knowledge in OS and system understanding) and when i got answer from every HR, they said that is nice to hear i have knowledge and interest, but they take people who are mostly student or after graduated as IT- or Cyber security educations...\n\nSince i have basic & Advanced Cyber Security knowledge, but there have still something i haven't learned are in this Google Cyber Security course, so i'm just gonna get this google cert in Cyber Security and lets see if they will take me or not.
@markclassen3067	I'm trying to learn Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, Python and Cyber security. What should I do?
@vasilio4980	hi, so what cerificate you would reccomend for a newbuie to have a much better chance of actually getting a job?
@VicMansaMusa	he is selling a course, of course he will sell you his or he would've recommended a Cert in this video that you can take instead of the google one.
@RantingMike	What about the IBM one on Coursera, have you tried that one?
@Joe-vc3ph	Finally one honest review  in  youtube
@williamcattr267	Overall, would you say that the Google course gives a boost for someone looking to prepare and earn an industry certification (comptia security+) in cyber security?
@harry8912	Google Cybersecurity Certification is great. I don’t understand this video. I’m not saying it’s 100% good but it does the job. 70-80%. I plan to take the Security + after the new one in November and I know I’m gonna have to study all my notes and a few extra things that the new exam will have.
@Trihope	So what do you recommend as a better alternative?
@sandy_4677	hello Sir first of all thanks for providing this content I had one question if I purchase One course for 1 month and not completed within it does my course expire?or does it asks for another Payment?
@will1908-m9j	Thank you for your Review, I almost started this Certificate.  I have CySA+ and other certifications and still cannot land a job.  CySA is IAT II according to the DoD and yet nobody realizes it is higher on the food chain the Sec+
@will1908-m9j	 BleuBillions  to date over 400 resumes.  I get told an array of different reasons why i don't fit the bill.
@hammondworrell6798	Thank you very much. We need more objective reviewers. You have my subscription..
@RobertLoyale	I’m in it now. I’m not saying it’s a bad program…not saying it’s the best. But I definitely don’t think it should go into the trash lol. \nIt’s definitely surface level. But then again, the focus is on getting a SOC Analyst position.
@JohnCutter317	Absorb all info you can just dont expect a job from any degree or any certs its a combo of those things and entry level work. I can see benefiting from it before taking professor messer course back when i took security plus. It serves a purpose. People have no concept of what to deep dive in in the beginning
@kiho847	Thank you for doing the actual work and your honesty.
@nikki35562	Do you recommend to learn code or at least the fundamentals prior to taking the corse?
@franciscoharo5921	Thanks for the info, I was really thinking about taking this course but wasn't too sure about it. Now I know, I'm glad you shared that info, cuz I don't really need this course. Thanks!
@ZeNex74	Oh, was going to start it in january. Maybe skip and head to security + instead? Im in desktop support... ty
@ermesborgnino4704	High credibility.  Thank you for this video.  Your opinion is important, even if it's against the grain created by Google.  The fact that you made it crystal clear you took it, got it, and are providing feedback about an ostensibly important cert.  Now, i am convinced that this cert isn't all of what i've heard.  The fact that Windows ain't included is a big miss in my opinion.  Thanks to your video, i will look at and strongly consider other means to learn CySec.  Excellent content.
@christopherneal1218	So I have a question ? Who offers the best online certificate program for those new to cybersecurity
@fluffyisyermom7631	Where can I get an Introduction to sql if this is so terrible. Time wise I agree but not for the skills it offers
@shafialanower3820	Think you are better investing your resources on security blue team or some form of practical certification. The depth you get in a coursers is kinda superficial imo
@TyDeshaun	Would’ve been a bit better if you would specify which routes you’d prefer as well. But still a GREAT video!
@dineshmekbrown5042	Hey thanks for the honest review..\nI have enrolled for the google course in cybersecurity like a montha ago.\nSo after watching your video i got struck in dilemma of what to do further..\nCould you please recommend me the better cybersecurity program which provides internship either..?
@dineshmekbrown5042	 @JonGoodCyber  would you recommend the way to get a job in cybersecurity field INDIA, because in India the jobs in the security field are not so encouraging and no entry level friendly.
@dreadlordnitsuga2	What would be the alternative?
@exileduniverse	go to college and get a associate's degree
@peedee718	Due to a grant I signed up for through the NYS Dept of Labor, I don’t actually have to pay for the course. With that said, would you still say that the course is a waste of time seeing as I don’t have to actually spend money on it?
@jackqtvsstuff715	Its definitley a good step to get your foot in the door for certs like sec+ and other certs but it won't get you a career
@georgesvak5332	Hi Jon, so what I understood from your video is that cybersecurity course is a waste of time? I'm in my course 2 and I'm not sure if should continue with the cybersecurity course cerifcate.
@whitehat_stanley	I appreciate your insight, I’m half way through the course.. I was wondering why there was no window OS been discussed.. Please what path do you suggest for someone like me projecting towards cloud security and application security?  Looking forward to your response… thanks again for the videos!!
@NJames2430	Lol I chuckled, it’s definitely not needed. I did most of my reading with ChatGPT and YouTube videos for 2 months out of a job. I just secured a senior information security analyst role paying over 6 figures with further training covered by the company. Lol I played the game well but truth be said I have a masters degree in computer networks so I am definitely learned. Was stuck doing a technical support role and new I could do a lot better
@NJames2430	I also thank you because I cannot count the amount of times I referred to your videos and really liked your explanations.
@madzad	I like how there's multiple people saying how much it helped them in passing Sec+, yet Jon is replying to them all like nooooo it's not good
@jamesr5735	Do you think I would be better served taking a different job that would pay for my full degree in cyber security even tho it’s not in cyber security they will pay for associate,bachelor, and masters as long as I work there
@plugmenace8513	Where should we get a online certificate then if not from google?
@plugmenace8513	 @JonGoodCyber  ok I’ll check it out then
@lautarolopez9992	Thank you very much! I'm an argentinian Systems Engineer (Similar to a Cs. Science Bachelor) that is trying to make his way into cybersec, and all the people are talking like you'd get this certificate and land a job instantly. Do you think that I could land a job with my degree and only one cert /course ?? Greetings
@BennyBoi_07	So is it not free? Google is advertising to sign up free... do they just hide the cost until after?
@MrJoc357	Got my Sec+ in Oct 2023 and still have not landed a job, I cant even get help desk to give me an interview. I was told i should get this certificate to add to my Sec+ and it should help but now after watching this I must go back to drawing board :(
@Justin-gn2rx	You might also want to update your résumé \nDo you other certifications ?
@cmartin8093	What s funny enough, I got a problem with their IT Support Professional cert. Their networking part of the course to be precise. One of the reasons why I went with the IT Fundamental Plus cert
@erikv2540	Hahah me too a recently completed it and it was rough… not a great course but it did help I won’t lie
@positivevibes7093	Q= So it would be safe to say for a rookie like myself. To start from ground zero, this would be a good path.
@jackthibo7644	Thanks a lot for this great review! Which equivalent course would you recommend that would cover what google claims to cover?\nNot from an employers poibt of view but rather as someone that needs the experience and knowledge as a freelancer
@ToyaTheStylishNanny	What do you recommend?
@a_aronhdtech	Kool research. Much appreciated. Myaon question is, if I'm a mechanic with home computer experience would this get me into the cyber security career?
@a_aronhdtech	 @JonGoodCyber  financially how much will the path you created cost and how much time, on average? I'm 50
@juancorro9744	Hello, I’m a civil engineer from venezuela that always liked the world of technology and cybernetics; now I have 2 years living in USA and want to have a cybersecurity certificate, my question is, do you think I can if I don’t have any studies about this field before? Is like I’m gonna start from zero
@juancorro9744	Thanks bro
@juancorro9744	 @JonGoodCyber  hi Jon it’s me again, I hope you see my comment, I’m decided to start in the cybersecurity world, your videos and you ebook have really helped me, I just have a question, I’m worried because in indeed, I see almost every job that sets a requirement for entry level that says “bachelor’s degree in computer science or related field” so I’m worried because of how I’m gonna get my first job with the certifications but no degree in this area (I have a Venezuelan degree as a civil engineer but I don’t know if they see this as a related field ) what do you think? I strongly need a degree I computer science or something similar to get that first job?
@Joeee20	Hey, i am starting my career in cybersecurity, i started with the microsoft cybersecurity course and looking to take the microsoft sc-900 exam and go on with sc-300 & sc-100. My question is, is that a good path to land a job in cybersecurity?
@Joeee20	Also what do you think of the Microsoft course?
@mr.meeseeks6549	Took it to prepare for the Security+. Good program, but I find the material a little too basic for me and know the Security+ is much more difficult and goes over many more topics than Google.
@sahilsvision	" @JonGoodCyber  It says ""Partcipation is optional"" I stopped participating after after the first prompt."
@francisnoel2124	So what is the best online course to take in order to get a job in cyber security?
@Jay_Ban	While completion of each course we get a certificate right so do u have your name in it ? \nBeacuse i cant see mine. I've already completed three courses of it \nPlz reply
@Jay_Ban	 @JonGoodCyber  instead of my name its showing courseera learner ...what does that mean ?
@Jay_Ban	 @JonGoodCyber  Thank you so much for your response ..its showing my name now after i verified it .
@Therealsupremeleader	Hi, whats your take on the Google IT Support cert and thank you
@Therealsupremeleader	 @JonGoodCyber  thank you
@the1thatgotirwinhard	Do you have a video on the Google it support certification?
@starmkd18	Fair review however you forgot the Google has the IT support certificate going over the windows OS and system admin and networking stuff
@starmkd18	 @JonGoodCyber  understood however I don't know why anyone would try to get into cybersec without having any idea about the file system, OS, active directory, basic networking principles, being a tech supper user etc\n\nI think they should recommend the IT support course first
@SachinSharma-zv9tz	Sir what is.GRC.. and  can grc can help the entry level jobs .in INDIA
@CCGDude	I am enrolled in a program from uso while serving in the Air Force, which program do you think is best? The google or ibm programs?
@juliovazquez3698	So, what other online option besides Curseea would you recommend?
@sagekasady4326	I appreciate the honesty of this review and you not taking the sponsorship
@ARTHURJOSEPHTIMEPIECES	Thanks for the info, I am presently a lab protection officer for the Department of energy and studying to get into the cyber security field I stopped the Google and started studying for the CompTIA Security+
@ARTHURJOSEPHTIMEPIECES	Absolutely thanks again, I wish I had found you prior to purchasing prof messer’s program!
@pickyourbrainswithbenjamin761	This is a very well thought review do you review other Google certificates
@LCTesla	The weak part of these coursera courses is the testing. Passing the exams is absolutely trivial and most of the more elaborate assignments don't amount to much in terms of challenge either. The cert of completion proves little more than that you took the time to sit through it. Hence why its paramount to get true certification like security+ afterwards and prove you can pass a properly proctored exam.
@AviationZero	Well, this puts a damper on this. I'm on module five. For what's its worth, I hope this will at least be me somewhat prepared for the Security+
@J.RicardoFernandes	Hi Jon, hope to find you well. First I am Grateful that you made this channel. It is very confusing the roadmap for a entry level cybersecurity analist. A lot of confusing information. I realize one thingh most of the certifications have a lack of hands on and labs, really pratical cybersecurity. I just finished the Google IT support studying Comptia A+ and Network + as a foundation of IT. I do not want to be a importer in my future Cybersecurity career. I am planning as my roadmap to do the Google Cybersecurity and also the Microsoft Cybersecurity analyst, and, at the same time use the Security + as a self study (again everything in Comptia is very theorical no hands on labs) to create the foundations. After this goals do the Cybersecurity roadmap in Try Hack Me and in StationX, very pratical. What is your advice? Thank you for your attention. Best Regards, Ricardo.
@gg.no.re.	If a course is not helping you land a job, it's not worth it. Simple as that. I got the Google because I heard it was great and cheap but despite getting it, I can't find a job to save my life lol. I have other certs too (like A+ and Qualys) but even with those the Google Cybersecurity Cert doesn't seem to be helping me at all and you NEVER see it on job listings... ever... literally not one time and trust me, I've checked lol.
@Aries_Alpha	Cyber security graduate here, I won't be wasting my time with it that's for sure.
@ggggg-mo9vl	Do we get a certificate for each course or do we only get one certificate for all the 8 at the end?
@ggggg-mo9vl	 @JonGoodCyber  oh thank you!
@jewels2113	I haven’t finished the video yet so if you address it I’m sorry for asking but is there anything you would suggest to try out for cyber security or even just IT in general for someone with no experience and wants to change careers
@gursimarkaur3452	Hlo sir thank you for your honest opinion , but it would be a great help if you can tell some better alternatives to this course if this is not that good , i mean which will be more in depth about cyber security for beginners .. pleasee  help
@gursimarkaur3452	 @JonGoodCyber  thank you so much !!
@westsi1	6:33 - 6:46 Wait what?? It takes 6 months to complete if we study 7 hours a day? But you completed everything in 4 days?? This puzzles me.
@eli_chaps	It seemed more blue team oriented. Love the review it was on point. As someone taking the course I see SQL is uncessary
@gtheentreprenerd7207	I love your hand engagement! And I'm glad you told me about  how they don't teach you anything about kali linux! I'm really interested in kali linux, and need a course to teach me that!  Thank You!
@joshuawinter7110	So my question to you is what would you recommend?
@DANIISLAA	I am looking at the ebook you mention and in resources for example security+ I see that there are books to buy on Amazon and a website where they offer you for a price to train you. I don't see anything practical, I see a lot of theory, am I wrong?
@racoonboyo4607	your thoughs on Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate
@saedyaish7768	If I pass the eight parts, do I get a certificate or is there a test?\nThrough the webcam, knowing that I am weak in the English language, I passed the first part certificate with a grade of 92%؟
@StoicGritNexus-wk2ci	I am new to IT sector.  I have zero knowledge whatsoever but can I take this course and land a job based on cybersecurity.
@_..____	Ok - now what do you recommend?
@darkseid_sfa	then what entry level cyber security certs you suggest?
@farhadtajdar-h6y	as a beginner where should  i start cyber security
@nomad7317	Thank you Jon! This was great & informative! I think I need to find another way to break into Cybersecurity from Software Engineering, without this Google Cybersecurity Certificate.\n\nGoogle at this point, thinks it can sell ANYTHING! They're trying to onboard more sheep.
@shawnkaida842	I can't agree with you more, especially for Python discussions. The course stressed the importance of Python - probably because Google wants to hire people with Python skills. I know this is sponsored by Google, it doesn't talk anything about Microsoft or Apple environments. The course was good recap for me to review the knowledge, but definitely not a universal recommendation for the people who has not yet worked in cybersecurity in the past.
@Differentmoons444	Are people getting jobs with these courses though? That's my worry. I wanna begin, but if someone's gonna tell me I need a degree and close the door on me, then what's the point 
@aniketsrivastava1870	Is it ok to take this course just for a label to put in my resume and then gather more info through other sources?
@CamdenMade	Four months to completed so $200 wasted no one is hiring right after this program. Although it is a good foundation you have to continue to do the leg work to build a portfolio and network.
@jamiusamin	I really appreciate your honest review of this Course for, I'm using it to prepare myself for SECPlus which I think is worth it also we shouldn't expect them to Cover it All.
@JoseHernandezMdez	Im a beginner on this, and i want to start a career in CyberSecurity, just finished this Google CyberSecurity cert, if someone can  help me to guide what i need to do next,? What i should do?? Ill appreciate it
@sleazy6290	I think people should note that Google gives certificates when completed and CompTIA gives certifications. Google doesn't have proctors to complete and CompTIA does. That should tell you the value alone
@ChiSoul	What courses or programs do you suggest for getting training in CyberSecurity?
@idaselinahobbs9031	Thank you so much for speaking the truth and saving us time and money. Blessings from Cyprus. 
@HankScorpio355	Anything on Coursera that you think is better?
@vcraig6531	Thank you for sharing. I'm changing careers and I'm  interested in tech, just don't know where to start.
@adolfocampos2248	Hi I want to change my career and I’m interested in cybersecurity but I don’t know where to start. I would like any advice on what school or online classes I can take to start in the right direction. Thank you
@r0d1tub2	"Theres the Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst and the IBM Cybersecurity Analyst in Coursera but I think Security + certification is seen more like an industry standard for business to hire someone\n ""just my opinion please don't hang me""."
@gamingwithrafi4895	What course do you recommend to get started then ?
@gamingwithrafi4895	Thanks  @JonGoodCyber  
@JLThisisMe	It's pretty refreshing to see an actual honest review (and not one that just starts off with a misleading premise then pushes you to an affiliate link). It's also pretty impressive that you actually took the course. I've been considering trying to get into this field, but after doing some research it seems the prevailing opinion is that this course really isn't going to give you a leg up unless you are already working in IT (helpdesk at least) and you aren't likely to be able to leverage the certificate to get even an entry level cybersecurity job. Thanks for putting in the work and insight to actually add value and not just manipulate traffic.
@kuasha9049	Agreed, not that good as they say! In the certificate, they mentions that the identity of the certificate owner is not verified! How horrible!
@be4rforce0ne89	i thought that the google cert is just a prep for comptia security+
@artofkhaos2336	Only reason Im doing the Google cert is because my public library got me a free coursera account.  Figured might as well.
@artofkhaos2336	 @JonGoodCyber  good point
@inmortal131	Really ?
@NanaW-bq7vo	Thank you for taking the time. I like your intergrity.
@smoothiniabdi6725	Hi Jon, How do I start a career in Cyber Security?
@bektendosmambetov938	Thanks for your honest review
@WalterDeRooij	6 months at 7 hours per day?\nWhere did you get that from cause that doesn't come from them.
@stvn0378	Any recommendations to good alternatives?
@kishk0	The Google cert is better than security +  from a learning and experience standpoint….IF you actually execute cybersecurity tasks in as a part of your portfolio.
@TheFreshAirChannel	So what is a good alternative to Google Certificates for training to get an entry level Cyber Security job?
@stanch2184	Jon as a beginner I was waiting in your conclusion to hear some best cyber security foundational courses in comparison to Google unfortunately didn’t happen .
@nairobipittman7708	Wait, What??? You completed the entire program in 4 days.....I need notes please......
@Sunnyside2424	There’s no way! 
@bhanusingh1498	I applied for this course but charge of 1488 shows on the Coursera page… This is not free of cost training programme
@myakiley3346	Just signed up for this course and then watched this video. It may or may not be good but as a beginner like myself I hope it's enough to get my feet wet. I want to be an ethical hacker someday and one of the certifications I would need Comp TIA Security +. If google is going to give me 30% off of that cert then I'll take it lol. Just hate the idiots that try to make it seem like its all that though. So money hungry nowadays.
@myakiley3346	 @JonGoodCyber  I made the choice to run through it and completed it in like one day and now I have a discount so I'm happy/
@bernadetteshiels5240	Great respect for your honesty. Thanks.
@leighthomas2915	So plan is to do this google cert and then prep for the sec+ and once I pass both apply for a gov job …. I mean is it straight forward like this ?
@cristianocr7-s2p	Hello, please I need a guide. I am about to venture into cyber security and I am confused as there are loads of courses on Coursera and I don't know the course to start with. I am a total newbie and I will love to also take on a mentor as I am ready to learn.
@Chaggysec	I really want to learn cybersecurity, but I don't know where to start
@ZeeshanAli-jx8cd	what are your thoughts on Microsoft course?
@alexabramiuk	What are your thoughts on Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst professional cergificate?
@alexabramiuk	 @JonGoodCyber  thanks for the answer!
@NinjaBooKitty	It seems like you are downplaying the Google cert in favor of your own training. Do you offer certification?
@victorokyei4464	Can you still land a job without a college degree?
@Linux333	Googles cybersecurity certificate is not a DoD 8570 exam
@Linux333	What is the current standard?
@Linux333	 @JonGoodCyber  it’s still qualified. CompTIA currently has approval for 8 of their certificates across 31 work roles under DoDM 8140.03 which includes Sec+
@yusufbayo5062	Please do comptia usually offer discounts for their certification?
@yusufbayo5062	 @JonGoodCyber  Okay,I appreciate the reply.\nI will be saving for it
@Derek.Mitchell	I think it’s most valuable as an intro to cybersecurity. It’s not worth much (if anything) on its own, but it helps build immersion and is a decent first step towards Sec+.\n\nOnce you have Sec+ though, it’s not worth worrying about unless you’re specifically targeting a job directly at Google, and even then there’s probably better things to make you a stronger candidate that you should spend your time/money on.
@Derek.Mitchell	 @JonGoodCyber  oh yeah, I didn’t mean to say that this in and of itself would get someone a job at google lol. I just think it helps to make applicants slightly more competitive if they can put a vendor’s cert or three on their resume when applying for a job at that vendor.
@Hand_me_a_handle	Wait what? It takes 6 months studying 7 hours s day but you did it in less than a week?
@itsevan1375	" @JonGoodCyber \nWhat was the point of the Easter egg?\n\nOr was the ""Easter egg"" an honest mistake?"
@MotherOfThings	I took it as a beginner. I'm not confident enough to go out and get a job. I did learn alot though.
@repoman54r35	I really liked the Google Cybersecurity Certification, however, I do just see it as an entry level overview. It does not prepare you for a Cybersecurity job. It is however a good overview of cybersecurity concepts and will help weed-out people who think they are interested, but don't really know about cybersecurity.
@kitfo18	I want to move to security to get away from the dying desktop role.  Microsoft even changed it from desktop to endpoint.  The role of desktop is going away and becoming none technical.  I don't want to be left out of the change I see happening in the next 5-10 years.
@mvppierce3412	so should we avoid this and not waste our time
@jenny-DD	After your F rating of Google\nDon't be surprised if your internet stops working correctly 
@ahmedakkrei7974	Hi, what about ibm cybersecurity anylist professional certificate
@underwaterguitar	great review. The Google course may be good for some, but thank you for an in depth and fact filled review. I know (without having to slog through a few modules) that the Google course is not the course I'm looking for.
@TTORREZ1	Thank you for your honest opinion !!  : )
@anonymoussource5344	When you say that you chat with other students, how is that done? Is it through the use of a chat widget or virtual like Zoom?
@Coral_dude	I am a CyberSec Eng and AppSec Eng - I have certs bc they are required by my employer. They taught me nothing I need to know.
@YungKashewz	Jon has a lot of integrity!
@allisonb9072	I appreciate this thoroughly knowledgeable and honest review. I’m tired of seeing YouTube videos where people truly only gloss over the topics themselves then make videos about why you should do something when they know very little themselves.  I was wondering if I wanted to go ahead and do the certification but was not sure based on my experience with the Google IT support Cert. when I took that certification, I didn’t feel like I had a great foundational understanding. I felt like I got way more from the A+ certification that I am preparing to take next month. I completed the first class of this cyber cert and it was OK. As far as knowledge I will just use a couple other classes as supplemental material like python and SQL  while I’m in school.\nThanks Jon,
@JackKapral	Interesting video, it helped me, since i've took notice with what google and coursera is pushing. So maybe make a video about the certificates that are in fact worth doing, for beginners and intermediates please? :D
@JackKapral	 @JonGoodCyber  Thanks!
@MuhammadBilalRaza-s2w	can you please share & recommend some good courses on coursera related to Cybersecurity and Ethical hacking
@bonybuinta1630	should I do the GCSC or the HTB academy CPTS ??
@Tony-xc5sk	Thanks for the heads up. You just saved me from wasting time and money.
@avangelinenicole8720	Q: Can anyone provide the best certification course(s) for Cybersecurity. Thank you in advance.
@SpaceFrogee	I know 0 about cybersecurity, and i guess this course is not great, but since my university is giving it to me for free,  i guess I'll take it to know the basics and not go blind into a course that's actually gonna be worth my money ️
@aimmingo	Thank you for the information. I couldn't wrap my head around a several hours a day, 6 month course being entry level. (isc)2 cc to Sec+ it is!
@zuberkariye2299	You can finish it in 3-4 weeks actually
@NickyBLive	I want to work remote and travel at the same time.
@Zahid.ally.	Sir I enroll in cyber security course three days ago I choose first foundation of cyber security can I get certificate after 6 month or I will complete the all course is compulsory for certificate means I spent four years there are 8 course of Cyber security please give me answer?
@Zahid.ally.	It is good to do only one course?
@maged4087	I do not agree... I am a beginner and I found this certification is great as guidance to me and understanding the skills I need now to build after this certification.
@sethelledege4806	How beginner were you? Did you have a Tech  background prior? As for me, I don't have any tech knowledge, I want to learn though. Is the IT Support certification good for me to do?
@saintgamer6973	It’s okay to have a wrong opinion sometimes
@AxeuweuecaEbceu	For real
@durvesh-g6l	so should i pay for one month instead of 3 months for the certification
@exileduniverse	get an associates agree. talked with a professor today a simple 1 year certificate isn't enough.
@zacharyjohnston70	its...aight. it feels good to get the cert, it gives you a board overview of security principles. career circle is absolute shit. the labs are awful. both THM and HTB have free linux modules that are so much better, and network chuck has waaaaay better python education. I dont even remember a single thing about AD which i think is weird. Overall, it is only worth burning through as fast as the can to get the SEC+ discount at the end.....which is another cert i feel like was a waste of time.
@siryakenga1425	I took the program and I found it good as begginer. It's much more detail than Isc2 certified in cybersecurity program which I also took.
@keletsoMatlalaBouy	Were both of those free?
@yamatanoorochi3149	Where can I learn cyber security for free? I can't do online transactions
@yamatanoorochi3149	 @JonGoodCyber  you are so helpful sir, thank you for the advice, I will check out your page right away
@SuperLucian92	Does anyone have a recommendation where to go to learn the trade?
@NataliaAraujo-ge8wb	Great video! Thanks!
@FredTechSc	very well put !!!!
@kayleighcoleman2449	Is there an affordable legit course that you know of that will land me a good job?
@fiecylick3981	A lot of coursera seems off. Like too much introduction and taking forever to even get into the topic. Seems cringy and felt like no progress was made in actual knowledge or development.
@paulboakyeyiadom2878	You're acting as a hater. This is a very beginner course and it's the best of its kind among the rest. I've intentionally done like 5 or 6 beginner courses and none can be compared to this. If it belongs to the trash, tell us what, in your opinion or to you, it's the best.
@ravencurtis2494	Q: So, Do I cancel my subscription? It's the only thing I can afford
@TiaaBankss	Coming here first before I sign up
@aadikiller2935	Sir is this cert enough to pass the security+ exam??
@jfkst1	I'm sure they aren't getting any decent jobs from such an introductory course. My understanding though, is that it was very effective at introducing new cyber students to the different paths of cybersecurity.
@gethrolacroix1551	Awesome video bro!
@MiddleClassAmerican	In a seasoned IT professional's view the course may seem lacking but for someone who trying to get their feet wet for the first time, I think it's a good course and it may even get you in the door.\nI will take entry level IT position any day over flipping burgers.
@gilangradip	Thank you Jon!.
@sharn377	I'm very new to Cyber Security and i'm 30 years old. I want to get a job in cyber security so i can learn to protect myself and others from assholes and scammers. But also, money lol
@dudesontstealmyemail3702	 @JonGoodCyber  I’m glad I came across this video ? Before purchasing the program , what’s your best advice on how to get all the knowledge and certifications to get hired without going to school and spending a lot of money to do so?? I would love to be pointed in the right direction as I’m very ready to change careers as this field is growing more and more by the day.
@stanf5488	6:35 your mistake, correct is 7 hours a week NOT 7 hours a day.
@jennifersilves4195	You can get Coursera monthly for I think $59/month, first month $1, which is where I'm still at, planning to finish this weekend.\n\nI think of this course a relatively painless way to familiarize myself with vernacular, methods, and tools so that I know what to study on my own as well as reinforce that I actually do know things. \n\nThank-you for this.
@jennifersilves4195	 @JonGoodCyber  I'm done with it now.\nGoing to try a persistent Tails USB for spy clout and a Kali for practice.\n\nDo and document the things.\nStart making green squares again.
@jimdunn1472	Seriously? Six months and seven hours per day!?!?  And you completed it in 4 days?\nI don't get the math. Please explain.\nThanks much for this vid btw. 
@jimdunn1472	Time index 6:30 - 6:45
@richpoorworstbest4812	I work at a Cybersecurity academy in a military setting. I did this course sort of for a laugh.\n2 things. \n\n1. the first 7 days are unbilled which is why you and I got it free.\n\n2. Calling it trash is a bit much, you know a lot and respect practical over theory, for a rookie, this is a decent opener which can be done in 2 or 3 months at a guess for a rookie
@jessjessstayflyy	"This review is very much giving ""Why would anyone buy let alone drive a Mini Cooper?"""

@jeffnaval4894	Hi Jon, Can i add this certificate to Linkedin?
@jeffnaval4894	 @JonGoodCyber thank you
@locksmithservices7571	AMAZING !!! what will you recommand ?
@sendoprey	Suggesting an alternative would have been helpful.
@lahcentizi	Damn Jon, I started getting the feeling that I wasted my time on this certificate.I am almost done with it.
@lahcentizi	 @JonGoodCyber  thanks
@rreed336	Great full review 
@historymistry9824	i am currently on course 4 and whatever you said is absolutely correct but they are much better than my college teachers
@mnageh-bo1mm	wow really useful mate
@j.joseph5353	Did the cert and imo it was a complete waste of time. Even if you have never worked with computers, the cert is designed so poorly that you could pass with little effort. It does not test any knowledge; it really only tests your test taking ability. For multiple choice questions, if you get them wrong you can retake the test on each section 3x per DAY. Process of elimination will get you to a passing grade even if you're completely lost. The labs often have the answers to earlier problems contained in later problems. A good 30% of the content is on the trust system. Here is an assignment......click 'Done' if you completed it. Ok. Done. A bunch of YT folks recommend the cert and now I have to question the value of their opinions.
@Ayyyyyrae	Hey did any 1 complete the program and get any offers?
@AdonisJashari-gg3yl	it says 7h a week not 7h a day!
@alfaizKhan333	brother is fighting for his life in the comment section
@JonathanChiasson-s4h	Sooo… is it worth it? Is it enough to get a job?
@sherekhan90	Bottom line is: you won’t get a job by just completing this course, but… it’s a great introductory material, so I wouldn’t entirely rubbish it.
@deanhaycox	100% agree with this video all the videos are sponsored, so definitely biased, they ain’t going to say anything bad as they won’t get sponsored again
@Maclah	Gotta say, my comment isn't paid for and I like it so far!

@ianlondon2888	If you talk long enough people can just take the course. Is the course career worthy, yes or no.
@chuck5430	Thanks for saving me 4 days.
@TLfU	Great stuff, thank you.  Sadly I can only agree with everything you reported.
@TLfU	 @JonGoodCyber  -  thing is I hadn't even been looking for reviews on it, but for something else on Google Account security...  Yet it's absolutely relevant to what I was considering.  So I appreciate the candour.  
@mohammedatef826	6:36\n6 month 7hr/week not per day!!
@Jade_X	so i should use the free trial and finish the course in a week,  sounds good to me !

@danielj9865	Lol wth?? How many hours are they saying it is for that cert?
@Jinjr322	1:49 how is that 10000% grade achieved possible????????????

@BabyVenom-w2n	You should add courses that are better than this one instead of just mocking.
@duppy9012	wait did you complete the whole cert in less than a week? haha nice.
@angelphavong3967	i feel like this certificate is a scam, you do learn things but most of it it’s intro level knowledge. You can’t take the sec+ after this. You won’t get a job after this, most cyber jobs require a degree, whatever youtuber you watching saying you don’t need a degree they’re lying. Either get a degree or gain hella experience in IT.
@blackdonte24	Bullshit, plenty of people in IT working off just certificates. Not to mention Google never tells you you can take sec+ upon finishing the course. They give you a discount toward the exam and study aids. Nice try
@seanjamesmacleod241	Funny he says this and yet other people in the industry say it’s a good course for introduction
@francisfrancis1153	It's better than the Microsoft version.

@yellew88	6:35 7 hours per day??
@VyseMalice	It's completely worthless. You can take 8 tests. Get the cert. Not watch a single video; and you get multiple attempts. Total course can be completed in less than 45 minutes; I took the ACTUAL CLASS like you did. Watched everything (skipping ahead on videos I already knew since I just passed my Comptia Sec+ and just wanted the dual badge for online resumes. My cousin worked as an IT HIRING HR PERSON FOR GOOGLE HERSELF, and at Christmas this year; told me to my face, struggling in the industry that she wouldn't even bother looking at my Github; she threw anything in the trash that wasn't a harvard style resume, and when I quizzed her on people lying on resumes and not knowing anything and getting jobs being a huge problem; and youtubers pushing complete lies about these certs qualifying you for a job. This type of fake certification nonsense is what's destroying the industry, aside from Machine Learning Models, which will replace 80% of IT jobs in the next 2 years.
@aouss.altwaijry	Probably most of Coursera courses are trash.
@markgreen2170	no windows, lol! you know, even microsoft is using linux now...
@YvonnMcCombs	+sub . looking for a google certificate that can give me a job.
@MALmaxx	The name says it all. CERTIFICATE = toilet paper\nYou need a  DIPLOMA to start with and a ton of experience .
@MALmaxx	Warever you say....
@triumphant_54	They all Trash, security plus is only consider great bcuz it's been around for Long and have been endorsed be the US government.\nGoogle cert on the other hand atleast give u a taste of hand on pratical which any good learner can use  and go deeper in python, Linux and SQl.all the theorical topic can still be dive into on all the framework website. My Verdict: Google Cyber cert is new n need improvement while security plus is overated, a bunch of theory and cramping for a exams and u don't really know how things work, if it wasn't for the endorsement by US government nobody will sit for Sec+, they should  buy books and read... \nBlue Team Level 1 should be gold standard for entry level blue team cert. Also CCD  is New but no entry to intermediate  blueteam certification can Touch it.\nIn Term of depth of knowledge and value for money.
@triumphant_54	 @JonGoodCyber  i respect your view and i'm aware of your Technical knowledge but like i said and will confidently say again. just reading a concept  will never beat reading a concept and applying it in a training. you're talking to somebody who have a tech qualification also and i did sect+ as a model. it's overrated for the price, it's overrated for the status it has. it's a highly endorsed cert that's why we all have to take it and that's the true. i will wait for 701 training when it comes out and i will buy your course just to proof my point.... take care Sir..
@jennifersilves4195	7 hours per WEEK.
@jennifersilves4195	 @JonGoodCyber  The six months is based on 7 hours a week not a day... people keep saying 7 hours a day. \n\nI appreciate the vid!
@odan7564	I am finishing up the google certification… is a woke mess…
@jeremymetcalf2502	Money grab.
@jeremymetcalf2502	 @JonGoodCyber  once you said you could go back at anytime to complete things, and you did it within a week, and they didn't red flag it?  Come on......
@jeremymetcalf2502	 @JonGoodCyber  What could you honestly learn within a week?
@jeremymetcalf2502	" @JonGoodCyber  my point is,  how does this benefit a hiring company, if someone isn't held to any standard at all?  I could probably Google all these answers and get a certificate.  There's no real accountability.  And if I mess up, I can just keep trying until I ""pass"".  \n\nI know I'm probably overthinking this.  But it just doesn't seem like it really does anything at the end of the day, except make Google/Coursera rich."
@lovelymaylopez2090	Thank you for the reviews!
@StockPileSparky	Very informative video thank you
@NicholasAdams-s4k	You did an amazing job! I feel more informed. 
@KennethLee-f1v	Seems like a comprehensive course, but I’m curious how quickly I can complete it if I’m doing this part-time.
@Hulme2-sn4dg	Thanks for the insights!
@Lucass9021	Has anyone taken this course already? How was the learning experience compared to what’s advertised?
@ChristopherLee-xo7jz	Sounds great, but how does it compare to other UX courses out there? I’m trying to decide between this and another program.
@NathanCooper111	This UX course looks pretty cool! I’m curious if it’s as hands-on as it sounds
@ITAngel	Nice!
@Evan_T11	I’ve seen mixed reviews. Is it worth the money, or just another flashy course?
@thorntoncaleb1122	Quick Q—are the tools they teach in the course industry-standard or just basic stuff?

@TheWindsofWonder	As someone almost done with the program, I’d say take it with the intent of taking the CompTIA A+ exam at the end of the course. The course does offer a joint Google IT Support/CompTIA A+ certification which I think is awesome
@jonblablabla1014	Is it free?
@geekatari4391	I was just about to ask if you knew of a CompTIA A+ course available in Coursera. You da man! I love your accent, BTW!
@lewisD122	thank you, Daniel, for your work
@Xenoose7041	Which is better BM IT support or google it support?
@Divyv520	Hey Daniel , really nice video ! I was wondering if I could help you with more Quality Editing in your videos and also make a highly engaging Thumbnail which will help your videos to reach to a wider audience ?
@Caleb_Bennett389	One more useful review, thanks.
@jacksonzenisek	Should I get the Google Support Certificate if I already have CompTIA A+?
@amer_sdeq	Kindly its just a course then they give certification ? or in final there is an exam ?
@MatthewThompson-ze2fi	It's reassuring to hear positive feedback about the Google IT Support Professional Certificate. Definitely considering enrolling now
@CameronWright-nj1zc	this is a perfect course! recommend
@Merhawi213	I live in Ethiopia I worked in IT before. I want to take this course how do I do that? Currently I'm unemployed and I want to learn.
@mikemurphy9977	Does this certification expire after passing ?
@kyledone24	Don’t normally comment but I started watching your videos back in October of 2021. After watching your videos and doing the Google Analytics Certificate I am starting my first tech job as a Jr Data Analyst! So thank you for all your videos and information, it definitely helped me on my career change.
@bryan1635	Hey Kyle! Glad things are working out for you! Can you share what you did during/after the Google Certification in order to land the job? Did you have previous related-experience in tech too?
@Edward55221	 @AlexTheAnalyst  How difficult would it be to become a data analyst without a college degree? You probably get this question often so I apologize lol
@mapi55555	I started taking the first two courses a few months ago after taking the Google Analytics certification, because I am working in marketing. I found them content to be pretty basic as well, very introductory, I stopped the course and started studying for the Marketing science meta certification by myself (I already have knowledge in statistics, Python and data modeling) by watching the blueprint videos and lectures. I passed at my first attempt, and I can say the most important thing is to understand the basics of Facebook products for data analysis, hypothesis, interpretation of MMM models, conversion and brand lifts.
@annamatinyan21	I really loved the course 3 of this certificate, I absolutely didn't feel any inconvenience about a bit dark background of the instructor, his manner of presenting the material was quite good and the content itself seemed great to me. This course sparked my interest for statistics and motivated me to take an in-depth statistics course. Actually, Google Analytics certificate is missing statistics completely (I'm right now in the last course of it) and in my opinion it is hard to do a thorough and in-depth  analysis of data without the knowledge of statistics. So I would really recommend course 3 to those who have completed Google analytics certificate.
@annmariedolan6959	Thanks for reviewing this, I have just finished some parts of the Google analytics course so I'm trying to find what to do next. I think the Google course is a little bit basic if you have analytics experience already, although I did learn things from the course that will help make me a more well rounded data analyst.  Great content as always 
@VictorsOtherVector	"Hey, I'm that ""character"" from the 2nd course!  Only watch 7:20 to 9:35 (especially @8:50), the part where it's about me & my part! \n\nBut more seriously, a buddy of mine follows you and I just so happened to check you out via them where I saw this review of the Meta course I helped build! I won't comment too much about the course & your review but I will say I think it's fair coming from a data analyst and there's always room for improvement for the team.\n\nI actually work full-time as a data scientist / machine learning engineer but I teach & help develop technical courses on the side. But I usually go the ""off-camera"" route or do live recordings (I used to be a data science instructor / curriculum developer at a boot camp, Flatiron School, where I would do live lectures). Frankly, it's nice to hear your relatively positive comments on the part I helped build and lead!\n\nI personally try to constantly improve (maybe my ""stage presence"" could be better ) but I won't lie and say that it didn't make me feel proud that you generally liked my section  I could easily see creating a whole course from just a couple weeks of the Python section, but of course there are real world restrictions & limitations that come into play in building a full course like this. And I am obviously biased towards my section since it's what most closely what I do in my day-to-day lol\n\nAnyways, thanks for sharing your opinions in this review! I know everyone on the team & I are always looking to improve! I've been wanting to go back and make more explanation YouTube videos on data science, machine learning, and software development so this has personally been helpful!\n\nI couldn't ask for a more honest and independent review from a data analyst! Keep it up!"
@taranicoleg	This was super informative! I graduated college about a year ago with double majors in business analytics and marketing and have been thinking about getting into more marketing analytics type work after working with more general data (and some heavy/advanced financial/accounting data - not my cup of tea) at my current job. I have the data background and general marketing knowledge, but not much experience in specific marketing analytics techniques - that part of this course may be interesting!
@desafiodatascience	"Thanks for the review Alex!\n\nSince I started my journey in the Data Analytics field, I have the feeling that Udemy courses made by ""expert individuals"" are more practical and better suited than those from big universities or companies. \n\nI am currently half-way the DA Google certifcate and although it is very well explained and the content goes straight to the point, it feels a bit slow and full of  things that in my opinion are important but secondary such as: communication, CV preparation, ethics...\nI had another bad experience with a popular Javascript course from Hapwkings University...\n\nWhereas other courses that I took about Python and ML taught by particulars are more focused on the skills. \n\nI guess we have to balance the possibility to get a valid certification and the actual content we learn. \n\nThanks again, love your content!\n\nCarlos.-"
@traderboulaleh9832	hi alex   i come from djibouti and i like   data analyse  and you help me to built hard portoflio   and you give me a confidence to start my journey as data analyste
@gkoranath4525	I disagree with the part where you said clustering is not related to marketing analytics... A lot of companies do use clustering for customers segmentation before they ads. I am not sure abt the context in this particular course though.
@frederickzoreta6617	Great review & feedback Alex !\n\nI myself am a data analyst who used to be a digital marketer / traditional marketer.\n\nThis entire Coursera Specialization is highly geared ONLY ( as Alex already stated) for those wanting to be in the Marketing Analytics space. I’d also like to add a few things:\n\n1. Even if you’re a generic or non marketing analyst, having digital marketing skills is still a good add on or even as a part time / side hustle .\n\n2. For this like me going into Marketing Analytics, this entire specialization gives you a FREE VOUCHER for the META certification exams. \n\n\nGood luck everyone .
@dennislam1501	Alex, Meta is launching five new courses this month, one of them is Database Engineer. But to review them need to wait till 2023 as the courses are released bit by bit
@dhiraj3933	Currently on my first course of the specialization. It isn't something I already don't know but it's a great collection of information considering I am a self learner.
@ezequielmartinez3582	Should i go to School for marketing  or just get my knowledge from websites like coursera?
@jayvillaraza9047	Hi sir Alex! I just been wondering is your tabluea tutorial series is done? Or are we going to see an intermediate series? Thank you sir Alex been a fruitful journey for me since I watched your videos.
@akshaymondal1372	Hey Alex, can you make a video on how to practice solving case studies .. It would be great for data nerds and me too
@АннаЩелкова-н9л	thanks for the video! Could you please give me a hint? I am currently working as a seo specialist and I have a desire to develop further in marketing to eventually come to marketing operations. Is this course going to help me get closer to that goal or should I just take a digital marketing course?
@Major_Data	Thanks for this, Alex! I feel like Marketing Analytics is a hugely underserved domain, considering what a staggering amount of money is involved. \n\nAlso because that's where I work, and it hurts my feelings that more attention is not paid... \n\nI'm working through the Google Digital Marketing course, which is fascinating but not super Analytics-focused.
@Major_Data	 @AlexTheAnalyst  it was cool to see that they had an entire course on MTA and MMM. I might go straight for that one - that's what my work section does.
@svetabogush8266	Can you please elaborate on how to get into first Marketing analytics job?
@Geomaverick124	They have updated this certificate since your last review. They've added a dedicated SQL and Python course
@Anevlo	Thanks for the video Alex - would you say your video on best courses for data analysis from earlier this year is still up to date or would you add any other course there?
@JOO4767	@olveyn very valid question
@iwanjuwana8288	Alex, what is the difference between IBM's certificate in Data Analysis vs. Data Science?
@kmetriqs	"It seems they updated the course. \n2 new sections were added: \n1. Data Analysis with Spreadsheets and SQL - 25 hours\n2. Python Data Analytics - 25 hours\n\nThe total time to completion increased to ""7 months at 10 hours a week"""
@danielbruck3103	Hi Alex, if I’m only interested in the marketing data analytics part of the course (I have finished the google data analytics certification, have python and sql knowledge as well). Do you recommend only taking section 4 and skipping the rest?
@narutochahid1486	Thank you for reviewing this course, I Have question about what courses recommended about finance for data analysis ???\nAnd thank you again \nHave a nice day
@Vikram_8621	Thanks Alex, this was helpful!
@VirenVarma12345	I’m in marketing should I go for Google or Meta program first?
@nasbidestroyerx	Hi, thank you for your amazing content. I am following your tutorials. So, far the journey is amazing. But I want to level up difficulty level and skill level. But I am unable to figure out how to do. Can you please make a video or series to demonstrate how actual data analysis projects work in real world organization. Thank you
@anmolmalviya2426	Hello Alex, can you please make a video on questions which can be ask in an interview from the projects you have created when we put them into our resume
@samuelnwakolam5158	Hello Alex good morning. I wanted to ask what subtopics in excel do I need to know to be a data analyst also? Like are we supposed to all the formulas and steps by heart? Please kindly advise. Thanks
@abdulwahabyisau5020	This is my first comment on here… I hope you see it… What do you think of creating a Discord server for your Data Analyst community maybe potentially help some of your community members build a type of connection in the data world? I know it won’t be easy with your schedule and all but please think about it️
@Anonymous-sw9zd	Do I need to know about coding to learn this course? I mean what if I have no knowledge right off the bat?
@andrewgus8763	Thank you for the review Alex. But I wouldn’t touch anything that comes out of Meta. Their massive corruption and lack of ethics really disvalue the reputation of their “certified exams” and may even hurt your resume. There is a reason why they ditched their Facebook name. Besides, it is better to go for more technical certs offered by actual colleges, better experience and knowledge.
@timothylee6023	What technical certs offered by colleges do you recommend that are similar to this & Google Analaytics?
@eluxury2	Thank you for your comment. I was initially considering taking that certificate until I found out it is issued by Meta Platforms. Your input has helped me make my decision. I will continue to search for other marketing analytics certificates.
@darielbaez948	What about the Meta social media marketing professional certificate? I’m taking it but what do you think about it?
@rashstyles9312	I am close to finish the Google Data Analytics professional course, so what's your recommend for this course? Do I need to do this or not necessary?
@s.h5836	Yea, the guy (your doppelganger) at 10:05, looks like he's recording his manifesto.  ️
@franzjosefbenjaminmacapaga278	hi Alex, can you also please review the Meta database engineer?
@henryezihe1245	Hello Alex, i already finished the google data analytics course, what course would you recommend for someone with interest in business abal
@utkar1	Thanks for keeping it real!
@DAnielIvey1	A Facebook data center is 5 miles from where I live, I think this would be nice if it helped people to get hired.
@vp7747	Nice review. Are you done with the google challenges ? Btw I also got the same link upon completion of the course.
@vp7747	 @AlexTheAnalyst  Great. Good luck with that. 
@neon_trotsky	How much time would it take to complete the course with 4-5 hrs everyday? I've already completed google data analytics course.
@onilbautista	most of the meta certifications are not yet done, just start on January,
@dennislam1501	Alex, i did all and passed first five courses. The last one I did not do as the course was NOT launched yet and not worth paying USD49 for continue.\n\nYeah the data grading really a low blow
@winteriscoming4407	please make review about the update since they add 2 course into it with python course
@cintheciege	Why you do my girl Anke like that lol? Honestly she kept me into it but yeah i feel you man thanks for the vid 
@paroxymal7688	Sir can i take this along with the Google data analytics one ? my goal is to become market research analyst.
@buzzsoftwareaus	Hello,\nI am from Bangladesh. anyway, I would like to know if I did IBM Data analytics certification then I could pass meta marketing analytics certification exam.\nIf so I will opt for IBM Data analytics certification.\nPlease tell me about it
@hakamabushanab1852	I liked you comment about the man at the basement 
@kbishop9360	I took his course and I share the same sentiment about the course being a bit boring and the support for the data analytics course was poor after running into a grading issue
@manitejachinni5863	Sir now I am pursuing integrated mtech 5 years course specialization in data science now I completed 3rd can you please say how to and how much I need to prepare to get decent job as fresher in data science sector because there are vast number of topics I am very confused like upto how many concepts I need to cover as a fresher to get decent job in data science sector
@jonathannali7682	I agree. It looks pretty basic. As someone learning Python, I wouldn't go for it. \nAlso Alex, you can always increase the playspeed of the videos. Saves times.\nFinally, I hope those Meta lectures don't come after you for your honesty 
@kesemadi8075	how long does it takes to do this course? and can you do it in a short amount of time? meaning, if it takes like 3 months, can you do it in a few days instead?
@PaulTurnerr	Hey Alex, Thanks for the info as always. \nBeing from such a large and well-known company I wonder if they will update the course or keep it more META specific.
@patrickmeehan6856	Boy all that negativity and you gave it a 6?  Based on your underwhelmed analysis, you should have given it a 3 or 4.  \n\nThanks for your review of this course!
@optimusagha3553	The doppelgänger comment !
@ballibhatia4481	Can u plz review my assignments
@shivsharma9153	To be honest data camp is better.

@RyanMartinez-je3se	After watching this review, I'm ready to analyze all the data in my life, even my Netflix watch history!
@fionnualawilks6509	Would you say this is more comprehensive than the Khan Academy’s free data courses? I’m on a budget
@Wyatt_Coleman	I'm looking to upskill and transition into a more data-focused role within my current company.
@MrD_2314	Daniel, do you think this certificate alone is enough to land a job? I’m skeptical
@creativearch9759	I'm skeptical about online courses in general. Can they really prepare you for a data analyst role?
@brianwilson1849	Can’t wait to enroll!
@lucazlee9542	I wonder if more affordable options exist for someone who wants to learn Data Analytics.

@MrAnderson990	I'm hoping this certificate will help me land my dream job at a top tech company like Meta.
@TheFreedomMaximalist	You have a very unique voice especially listening to to it at 1.5x speed
@XavierVincent-y2z	How much Python do they teach? I’m a total beginner
@MasonDD567	This sounds like a good deal, especially with Coursera Plus. But I wish it was a bit cheaper
@Samuel_Taylor	How hard is it for someone new to programming?

@Owen_Davis_yo_yo	I'd be interested in hearing more about the specific job opportunities you explored after completing the certificate
@ChristopherLee-xo7jz	If you need course reviews, look no further than this YouTube channel. Appreciate your work, Daniel!
@spyksyde	Maybe, but one can’t be sure when it’s being sponsored
@megrose3718	I’m interested but would like to see some student testimonials before diving in. Anyone here who’s completed it?
@SamuelHayes-dv7cs	Can anyone confirm if the course has subtitles or translations available for non-English speakers?
@Asher-nx8mk	I’ve seen a lot of high ratings for courses, but how do we know they’re effective in the real world?
@Brandon33Hayes	I’m pumped to start this Business Analyst journey with Microsoft! 
@SerhiiI-ol2lz	Can anyone explain more about the hands-on projects? What kind of real-world scenarios do they cover?
@missdesireindependance5194	I just found out about the Microsoft certification. I plan to take it.
@NoahBennett811	Does anyone else find it funny that a course about business analysis includes so much ‘hands-on’ work? 
@locosmiley2008	Man the voice is hard to follow.

@Brandon33Hayes	Can you also please do a video on the Business Analytics specialization by UPenn on coursera?
@AustinB3234	Very useful video, thanks
@AlexM-ne8jm	Daniel, you're a great creator but with so few subs
@aslanzakaria7536	I have a question if someone can help. I want to take the Microsoft Power bi data analytics certification from the offcial Microsoft website. Would getting the certificate from coursera perpare me for the actual exam to earn the certification? I appreciate all the answers.
@Roberts8780	Daniel, what do you think about google data analyst certificate?
@studywithqueen732	If I buy this course can I download learning video for a month
@DolonDhar-j1y	if i complete week 1 of the course in 1 week shall i be able to complete the course in 5 months?
@hariharan-cc4on	Hi, whats the difference between completing Microsoft Power bi data analyst course and Writing PL-300 exam in Microsoft? Whats the use of coursera professional certification course? Whats the difference between completing the coursera course and Writing PL-300 exam?
@Blakeblake1	Power Bi is much better then Tableau
@crazyT48	I use PowerBi. My girlfriend currently takes these courses. As I see they are great for beginners.
@nickloschiavo5128	How long does it take to complete ?
@superman69	Can this course hlp in my resume for MBA colleges
@jerryedits36	Is it free certificate course or ?
@MaffAndxu3jj	How much is this course???
@Dominic67Wallace	Will you prepare your own course about Power Bi?
@Wyatt_Coleman	I don't like Power BI. Tableau is simply better.
@Riley_Turner	Thanks for the review Daniel!
@mustafaninkanalindan	"I was searching the ""AI For Everyone"" course is updated or outdated and have found your video...Thanks Matej for your valuable content. "
@peace_truth1471	Nice review Matej!\n\nI'm deciding between this courser and the one from Harvard, the CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence :/
@bhavinbaldota4074	Does it have video's to see of just information to read.? \n\nAnd do you have any idea about \nApplied AI course
@Dinurao-n8d	Is this the same method they teach in college
@DylanD-fk4lt	Good video mate 
@SamuelHayes-dv7cs	Which is better to start learning, AWS or Azure?
@Murphy_G	What is the passing score for the final exam?
@Samuel_Taylor	by the way, good content 
@mrd6869	nice video but your accent is driving me crazy 
@Samuel_Taylor	I like his accent, so cute 
@wavyduck1273	the Maths for Machine Learning specialisation was one of the first that i've ever done on Coursera. and it's still my favourite set of courses i've done on Coursera so far.
@Berutoron	"Thank you for this recommendation, Giles. I just completed the entire course. tl;dr: I'm glad I did it, it's a great course overall and I would recommend people take it, bu unlike you, the reason I also found the PCA course (i.e. the third and last part) the weakest isn't because the teacher wasn't as personable as the previous two. For those interested, read below for my full impressions of that part:\n\nI didn't really mind the fact that the third teacher doesn't really connect with the viewer. Yes, they don't smile much and they don't have the same kind of energy as the first two teachers, but as long as the pedagogy is there, it's all good... But that's the issue really: the teacher and the content make too many assumptions about the students, and the pedagogy felt lacking as a result.\n\nEven if the course is labeled ""intermediate"", it's supposed to be the logical progression of courses 1 and 2, and it feels like anything but that. Mathematical concepts, formulas and notation are often glossed over in a sentence, with few visual or concrete examples, such that you're very quickly overwhelmed if your math knowledge isn't already way beyond what was expected in the other two courses. When you're not already really comfortable with (from my point of view) fairly advanced maths, too much abstraction can be very intimidating and a complete motivation killer. You just end up feeling like you're an idiot or like mathematics just aren't for you.\n\nThe course content is lighter (4 weeks only), yet at the same time, it covers far more complex topics, and it often feels like much less effort was put into it. For example, the teacher often defaults to giving you reading material - some of which is quite heavy on esoteric notation that is barely covered, if at all - instead of making explanatory videos. Another example: the feedback on quiz questions, most of the time, amounts to ""Great job!"" or ""Incorrect"", with no explanations. The quizzes themselves often feel completely disconnected from the lessons that precede or follow them. They can be extremely easy, or extremely hard, usually with no in-between. And the programming assignments can be strangely worded or contain mistakes at times, which can throw you off as a student. They certainly threw me off, even though I'm already quite familiar with Python and numpy. In other words, the substance of the assignments wasn't necessarily insurmountable - I was shocked how quickly I completed some of them, in fact -, but the way they're framed and explained made some of them more puzzling than they needed to be sometimes. All those aspects are big departures from the teaching style of the previous courses. Lastly, though this was also an issue with the other courses, the teachers and staff barely ever reply to questions on the forum. Not too much of an issue when the course itself is great, but for this third course, it didn't help matters.\n\nI realize I sound very critical, but again, this isn't to say people shouldn't take the course. They should take it, including the third part, if they have any interest in machine/deep learning and they need to brush up on maths. It's easily worth the €40/month - by the way, you can go through the entire curriculum in a month if you can devote 4-6 hours to it almost every day like I inexplicably managed to do. I just wanted to push back a little against what you said in the video, where you seemed to imply that people were unfairly complaining about some of the assignments. From someone who isn't already very comfortable with maths and abstractions but was diligently making their way through all the content regardless, let me emphasize: it's not just that the third course will challenge you and you should just deal with it; it's that it could stand to be improved, or at least give more pointers to helpful external resources (not just a link to a Wikipedia article). Being challenging or intermediate level isn't an excuse for an unbalanced difficulty curve or hasty coverage of complex topics.\n\nI will say this though: that last quiz before the final assignment forced me to do a deep dive on partial derivatives (especially the chain rule) and gave my poor little brain quite a workout. Genuinely thankful for that. And again, the previous two courses alone are worth enrolling for.\n\nLooking forward to more course/book recommendations! :)"
@taneemishere	for the third course it would be very good if they include the statistics and probability instead of PCA
@Mo.Faried	I am still in the second course, and you wouldn't believe me when If I told you that I already finished my Deep Learning specialization, but chose to study this specialization to gain more depth in the related math, and still I am impressed so far by the first 2 courses.
@TheYoRND	This course was really helpful!. It saved me in my first Master's degree semester.
@firstname4337	oh, I've been waiting for this review ever since you announced you were going to do it weeks ago -- YEA !  \nso happy to hear what you've got to say
@sbwiecko	excellent review, I would add that using/learning sympy in parallel helped me a lot following the course and understanding the mathematical concepts
@sumeetsiddhartha9031	i had started the course but couldn't find time due to work i would definitely pursue it, now that you recommend it
@cosmicpuma1409	"I am was not strong, when it came to maths at school but in in my ""post-high school"" education, I worked really hard and exceeded expectations. So much so, that my parents asked if I had cheated or paid someone to write my exams, lol...but this gave me the belief to overcome these fears I had, related to these ""high school"" shortcomings and changed my perception that DS, ML and AI were realms for other people, not me..... I have become really interested in these fields, ML and AI in particular. I am a long way from reaching my goals but your channel and  recommendation are useful, awesome, insightful and inspiring. PS: His new courses starts today and I just watched this vid! 5th July 2021 - Thank You so much."
@rorshackattack5280	Thank you! I've wanted to do this specialization along with a Deep Learning specialization. I am more confident to proceed now :)
@brahimboughanam1662	thank you for your reviews. really I was confused about this course
@MarioLopez-eu8tj	That's what i looking for some time ago. Thanks so much for the info Giles.
@cosmingutu8256	Can you please say how it relates to the Mathematics for Machine Learning book, do you think the book is more comprehensive?
@mousquetairekrypton3869	PCA is more complicated than computing eigenvectors or multivariable calculus. Although PCA is part of multivariable calculus.
@tuvelout	first thing after I started watching\n0:05 the amount of open tabs
@AungBaw	About to do that one, thanks for inside review
@justamortalman	Worth it! thankyou will check em out.
@optimizedpran1247	This guy is into programming but has old school British mathematician vibes
@MindfulSapient	I am wondering why did they not include any course on probability and statistics in this specialization. I took these courses during my bachelor's in engineering but looking for a resource to revise the subjects. Is there any other specialization that includes a course on probability and statistics that you recommend?
@milindbebarta2226	I'm doing the first course and its the best math course I have ever seen. What a teacher!!
@tauriqabdullah6130	What's your thought on Khan Academy? I haven't done math since I was in high school(2009) and I'm revising it from the ground up. I started with pre-algebra, on Algebra 1 now. Why am I doing this?  I'm interested in Data science.
@nayanukande5554	Yes there are some challanging labs and programming assignment....but after clear understanding of concept I found easy to solve and the tip is if you exhausted dont do it.......do  it with fresh mind.
@therzook	I am scanning through skills required for ML, very helpful indeed, at least I know I will be able to do maths ;)
@philipmariposa3067	I'm currently planning on taking the IBM AI enginerring course and am considering taking the Imperial College course in order to get my maths up to speed. Maths is far, far, far from my strong subject; I somehow managed to get an o'level and then avoided it until doing an Open University course on maths for science, in which I learnt more than I had in my school years. So... Am I likely to struggle with this course ? Is it a good foundation for ongoing ML & AI study ? Any snesible replies will be welcome. Thanks.
@Scythe6140	Actually I completed the first course of this specialization and having completed this far Idk why are people commenting that the assignments are hard. In fact those were totally based on lectures. After all this is the price you need to pay to learn something new and earn a certificate from a renowned institution. Otherwise just fast forwarding the lectures and solving just the petty assignment doesn't add any worth to your learning. Rather it is the best course for anyone who wants to equip themselves with the mathematical knowledge needed for machine learning.
@rhondaverma6358	I love mathematics… I wish I were younger so I could become mathematician. Now I just work every day and come home ….
@-steady-8215	Maybe. Just maybe.
@brianbrian7902	I'm here early today I just wanna ask I'm completely new to python where do I start thank you very much in advance
@jt099	Great videos. plaining to take this in the near future.  Cheer!
@alpborakirte801	I enrolled in this course when i could free because of my school account but i now i cant get a certificate without upgrading my account. So the question is if i add the course in my linkedin without the certificate when i completed the course does it matter that i don't have a certificate?
@rahulahuja1412	Very useful review. Thank you.
@-steady-8215	Does the first course teach enough linear algebra to be able to follow a university level ML course? I already know basic high school LA btw.
@fashionvella730	What I think is if you haven't done the math before I recommend to first cover Khan academy algebra, linear algebra and calculas playlist
@kyng386	Any recomendations, books or courses for learning algorithms?
@ControlTheGuh	What I was looking for. Ty
@j827	What are your thoughts on their MSc in Machine Learning and Data Science (online)?
@lade_edal	Giles, I was sceptical about this video as I don’t remember you ever anything slightly negative about a book or course you’ve reviewed. So I’m glad you pointed out that the third course is the weakest. However, you were still far too generous. Marc deisenroth has exceptionally poor pedagogical skills and as someone who has used, understood and applied PCA in my work for several years, I felt desperately sorry for anyone who came across this as their first exposure. The third course in this specialisation is simply not worth a student’s time.
@mariamqotob767	Well, thanks to this video I'm ready to re-learn math the right way.. thank you.
@anishray7401	Hey Giles. Thank you for the review. Is this course better than the free Mathematics for Machine learning book that you had suggested earlier on your channel? Is it worth to spend money on this specialization when that free book exists? I am asking since you had given a positive review about that book too.
@varun_.	Hey, if i want to learn this course but can't buy, how can I learn from youtube
@agracian1	Hi Gile, any thoughts on Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization course?
@weronikawojtak2091	I was about to ask the same!
@_AverageGuy	Definitely go for it! Andrew is one the few exceptional teachers who knows what he's teaching. You can tell from the amount of enrollments that he's a very good instructor.\nTotally worth it :)
@weronikawojtak2091	 @_AverageGuy  thanks! :)
@스머프-s7g	I agree with the point of that he's a great teacher and that the course is good and all of that, however, it should be noted that I think the course is better looked at as a way to gain a good foundation of the topic. Deep learning has branches such as computer vision, natural language, etc. He's covers them, however, obviously can't go all the way in depth. After the specialization, you should have a foundation of each branch, at leadt the ones covered, but be able to stem off to which to ever one you want. It should also be noted that I'm not saying that the course is covering the intuitions of each branch only, but I am also saying that it will be better suited for a foundation rather than making you an expert in each branch if that makes sense but at the same time, not a full out noob.
@rahafjw3927	does anyone have the notes for the specialization
@breakablec	Sounds very compelling
@EssDubz	"Your justification for why the assignments weren't ""too hard"" was all the convincing I needed that this class is bad. If I have to spend extra time digging in more depth online then there is no point to take that course in the first place. I'll just save some time and go straight to the research online step. Why take a course where they don't teach you what you need to know?"
@sagargupta1615	Please make review on applied ai course.
@maged4087	does this course help us with coding?
@Regimital	I finished the Deep Learning specialization and would like to take another course/specialization and use my Coursera for students credit on another course. Which of these two is better to put on a resume when applying for a DS/ML/DL job?\n\n -Mathematics for Machine Learning (Imperial College London - this one) \n-Modern Application Development with Python on AWS (Amazon Web Services) \n\nI took part in a hackathon, where we used AWS, so I guess some cloud-based experience would be useful in an industry setting, that's why I am considering that specialization.
@simplypqz	Is it THAT cold indoor?
@blackfrancis33	Better to take this before or after learning a bit of machine learning?
@msid9870	Great video!
@gabrielsuarez8858	would you advise to begin with python ? or html / css / JS  ?
@anishray7401	Can we audit this course for free without the certificate? Will all of the content be available if we audit it? Will the assignment problem solutions be available if we just audit the course?
@Dyslexic_Neuron	is it availbale on udemy?
@kitatanya	Thanks
@lena191	Anything about the price?
@SCJonathan	Genial Vídeo Bro!!
@samanwaybarman3316	Start reviewing bootcamps
@subhojeetlearning	I am not good at Mathematics. Where do I start to improve my maths?
@MuhammadBilal-zn2oy	is MatLab required for this?
@thedailyepochs338	What other materials did you use to solve the third specialisation of the course, i had troubles with it . Please include links and videos
@lizarettflavour	thank you =)))
@hgftdtduf	Can't open your courses link.
@SuperNova23333	How did you gety past that first programming assignment in the PCA class? It was impossible........ It took me over 8 hours to do.
@knosmichail75	Having completed the course myself i would say its quite demanding in theoretical level (mathematics) and practical level (programming)...It's not a course for a beginner....
@elp09bm1	thanks for the review, but I thought they should have added the Statistics and Probability course as well. I am designing syllabus for Mathematics for Machine Learning for my master's students. I think this is the course which I will consider.
@QasimKhan-nd8og	does this specialization cover all the requisite maths for ML though?
@mustafashapaan7141	introductory level courses
@judededude	Geeze - warning about this video - be prepared to learn
@kavourakos	Where are probabilities and statistics
@MrLegarcia	+1

@arissasolis8494	great video as usual.
@overtlycovert3610	Hey! Great Video!\nIf I buy the plus subscription, can I access the DS course along with Algo course.
@GaganNarang-i7s	i facing difficulty how to gave answer in this course please help
@janalexandersilvestre1693	Hi Daniel, can you review Princeton's algorithm course
@AlexM-ne8jm	is this certificate for beginners?
@ananya__f	please make a feedback video on data engineering course by IBM
@chrislofton3445	Same as well. Think I’m staring this today.
@shylutech591	what was the price for this certification
@EvordRiccie	I'm doing this course right now. I started two weeks ago, and now I'm almost finished with it. It's a very nice course. Also, I got a free course after my financial aid was approved. 
@lilnate2191	Found this course yesterday but weren’t many YouTube videos about it. Perfect timing !
@greenthumb7405	Buddy has his own stock videos. I love it!!!
@carloscuevas9475	 @Daniel-Dann  Do you edit yourself? or got some partnership with an editor? Thanks!
@fezekile228	I completed this IBM Full Stack Developer last month, very much information on this certificate,
@Ahmeddinn	Hey @fezekile228 I'm thinking of taking this or the meta back-end course. What skills have you gained after this, can you build full stack apps now? I found this course a little bit shallow when I looked through it. What is your take?
@jonathanwilliams1719	fezekile, did you have to pay for both the subscription and the course?
@Sammy2g3	Did it open any opportunities?
@TeressaCook-ul1ve	Please how much did you pay for the course?
@erickbravo5299	I have been taking the course since September. I am on the last bit of the 7th certificate. There are 12 certificates total. It's excruciating to say the least and I am a developer. There are many parts where I do not think someone without prior knowledge would understand or figure out. Also, they barley go over how to do something and then expect you to know how to do it on a test. There is a huge issue with their virtual environments as well, which leaves me spending hours trying to find a fix through forums and blogs. \n\nI am still pushing through, but this course is a mess.
@mukamvula	Please sir, what is better to do? To take just the IBM fullstack certification course or to take the fronted + backend IBM certification courses? Please, I need an answer...thaks a lot for the video!
@mukamvula	@SelfMadeProgrammer  Thank you sir...!!!
@HEADSPACEnTIMING	anyone: There some careers assume prior knowledge. If a cloud developer course needs to explain what a network or server is, then you need to exit the course and go learn fundamentals. IT fundamentals are not taught in Cloud.
@jonathanwilliams1719	Hi, to clarify, do you pay coursera subscription and course subscription? Or does the annual membership give you full access to this course with certification?
@federicoalbertogorrini6601	In broad terms, average, which one has more career opportunities and will pay more money: AI/machine learning specialist or software developer?
@oniichandame48	Nice video! Will i get the certificate as long as i complete the courses without additional payment other than my monthly subscription to coursera?
@omorfarukmahfuj	what would you say about ibm fulll stack developer course vs (meta front end and backend course)
@sniperzrgryteclocus	bro did you find it
@MrAlexu20	It s been a month I m studying this course, I find it very useful, lots of information, but the exercise part is not as brilliant. I hope that when I start the part with html css and js, there will be more exercises.
@mushk38	I have recently completed the wev development fundamental and explore emerging tech on ibm. I also have seven years of freelance jog experience from Upwork, Fiverr and Guru. I am a top rated. But need to know are these courses actually worth getting job
@jraze9725	There just one thing I didn't understand about Coursera. Do I have to pay this IBM course separately or it comes with the 380€ yearly subscription?
@jraze9725	 @Daniel-Dann  I was talking about this one on the video, the full stack. I win anyway. Coding courses costs 4k where I live
@robmijn	After reading mixed reviews on this course I have decided to enroll. Does this course help you build a portfolio of projects and examples to show potential employers?
@Tanishq_1803	IBM vs Meta full stack web development course
@KaranKanyal	is this course better than udacity fullstack development nanodegree
@saoudsarwar840	will the 3 months option be enough to complete this course? also is there a time limit upto when one can join the course or it can be enrolled anytime?
@T.H.E-MAN	is this course give you a videos of lectures or a online class?
@GabrielJackson-t9l	cool video)
@misbakhan6980	Does this course come with live classes to learn?
@psychTech321	is this suitable for 19 year old??
@jakemuhlestein8205	Can anyone tell me how much the entire course costs for the whole certificate?
@rubickon	So what is the price?
@humourstan7554	is it better than cs50 web development?
@gpsousa1	Great video my friend. How much it is after the free trial?
@bunny12249	If i complete cloud computing course after html css and js will in get a professional certification (iam applying course wise in financial aid).
@amshirakfirthouse7457	They provide free certification?)
@FedyaKhedoian	But not freee
@ВадимХамлій	cool video)
@Atlas92936	Hey Alex, I just landed a Data Analyst internship for the summer and I am really looking forward to it. Your channel has definitely helped me out. \n\nI am looking forward to taking this machine learning specialization as well. I’m planning out when to commit the time to study. Work will take up so much of my time in the day!
@coolzairhussain	Really glad to see this channel branch out into different fields of analytics! ML knowledge is really valuable to have, especially when it is displayed as a portfolio project on a resume 
@datping7377	Your content is amazing, I'm doing the google certification right now and I'm looking forward to start my portfolio with some of your tutorials!
@stillmattwest	I just finished week one of this course. There is definitely some math! If you're like me and its been a minute since you've really had to work through an equation, I would advise just slowing down and making sure you understand what you're looking at before moving on because each step builds on the last. \n\nAndrew Ng is a very good teacher, which is what makes the class work. ChatGPT is also good as an echo chamber. Try to explain the math to it, it will correct you if you get something wrong.
@yitbarekdemesie512	Thanks for sharing this! I was looking for a good ML course and this is exactly the suggestion I needed!
@CalvinOnTheCoast	So happy my college actually teaches machine learning in the DA program. So interesting.
@nayeem3905	Alex, great video as usual.  Question for you, how do you balance work with your studies and side hustle? What's your schedule look like on a weekly basis?  I'm trying to make changes to my weekly habit to be more efficient.  Would love to hear from you. Thank you
@thihiendao6291	Hi Alex, I really hope that you can see this comment. I really appreaciate all of your amazing works so far. It is really helpful. Can you suggest any kind of other sources like books or podcads to have a mindset in data analytics? Because I struggle with which questions to ask, rather than which tools and how the codes are written. Thank you so much for that, you are such an amazing man!
@lody33100	As always perfect review  thanks Alex
@omaralhajali3915	Thanks for sharing this you are a great teacher \nMy teacher can i get work after finish this courses ??
@shreyassridharan7765	Hey Alex, up to what level of python do you feel is required to take this specialization. Would you suggest to learn some prior math concepts before heading into this course?
@zabeebarsalan1385	Hi Shreyas ! I am already taking this course . For python you need to know what functions are , for loops , and what are methods . \nIn terms of math all you need is college level math . And You dont need to go through anything advance as Andrew goes through them in lessons as well. \nOne thing i must mention is that if you dont know python then understanding code will be difficult.
@Beyond_b1	Python or any programming knowledge or what I call computational thinking. Then for machine learning, you need statistics(300 level), Linear algebra( An absolute must) if you haven’t taken a course in linear algebra you will never understand machine learning period, and then some multivariate calculus and even basic calc. When I took the MITx class in ml it was clear people just didn’t understand what was going on.
@sharon_ng	Sad that I have to pay for the specialisation because it is not included in my uni's partnership programme with Coursera, but I think the fee will be worth it :) Thanks for reminding us of Andrew Ng using Python for ML, Alex
@tonystark3224	There are 3 courses within this specialisation. You can audit them for free. You will get the whole course just not graded assignments.
@sharon_ng	 @tonystark3224  but i want the certificates
@ozysjahputera7669	They give you 7 days free trial and it costs $49/month after that. If you can go faster, the total cost will be cheaper. I learned most of these stuff back in school, so I was able to go through these courses fairly quick. I am almost done with the 2nd week of the last course in exactly 2 weeks after starting with this specialization. Coursera planned this specialization for 10 weeks total (3+4+3). But if you do it 5x a week at 1.5 hours ea you should be able to finish it in less than 2 months.
@salehmehdizade	Off topic question. Please answer. How important is it to know statistics for data analyst. And if it is very important what would you recommend to learn? STATA, R STUDIO or anything else really. I am just stuck in regression and correlation. I mean I understand how it works but when you have a really big data manual calculation is not the best way. Just wanna know your opinion on this. Thank you
@Explorer_Nur	Hi Alex and everyone, \nPls I need help on how to upload my certificate from Coursera to Upwork. I've tried but Coursera is not among the list of options in the certification. Thank you all
@hasanmougharbel8030	great efforts in this channel.\nI have only simple enquiry as a new sql learner.\nI haven't made my mind yet whether to use sql server or not. \nIs sql server the best solution available for those who want to manage and automate databases inside a medium size company.\nIs there any alternative i need to consider right from the beginning or any applications that is relevant to integrate with the database being used.\nI consider myself a machine learning enthusiast and and would mostly like to automate business solutions with the engine being used.\nThanks for taking time to read this.. God bless you.
@Zivafgin	What are the differences to Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng?
@DK-ox7ze	Are all the video recordings in the updated course also new?
@sujaynazare489	Hey Alex! I have completed this course 3 months back. Is it worth to take it up again? Although I know R and don’t know Python!
@adamissa2493	Thanks for the review\nIs the course also useful for ppl who are more into data analytics ?
@siavashshojaat	Hey Alex,\nThanks for the review! Does this course come with a note? (e.g., a pdf or Jyputer notebook).
@swethav41	Hi Alex,\n\nIs this one Specialization course enough to learn Machine Learning and dive into a career related to ML?
@ikennanwankpa6354	Thanks Alex for a great review as always. Please what's the cost of this program?
@elenakoroleva5443	Hey Alex,\nThank you for the great review! Is this specialization available only in specific regions? The link is not working for me...
@milanpanic9614	Hey Alex, I have one question.. My english is meybe on A2 level, can I apply on any job? Data Analyst, Bussines Analyst... Or to wait and learn more english? Big greetings for You!
@a_samad	what about the python and its libraries? do they teach these?
@yiqiangjizhang	No slides are provided?
@animaze3606	How much money it cost to learn machine learning course from Coursera?
@ashokram6984	I have a doubt  , since it is called us Deep learning.ai ..is it just all about deep learning ..or it starts from scratch of ML to Deep learning..of should i do someother machine learning course before taking this... please help me
@ashokram6984	 @AlexTheAnalyst  Thanks
@mixcheladachannel6127	You have convinced me to take the course . I paid the $48 let's see how it goes
@gokukanishka	does this teach python as well ?
@AJ-ll1qc	I just found your page and I'm in the process of watching all of your videos. I just accepted a position of a administrative analyst and I like it so far, but I can't find much about others in this position. I don't get paid much ($17)but I'm okay with that for now because I'm entry and graduated with a BS in community health in 2020 and went from a screener,to medical records to my current position at the same clinic location. Where should I start to leverage on my new position of administrative analyst. I'm so sorry for the long comment and grammar but I'm searching for a sense of direction I desperately want to take this small opportunity and grow and I'm afraid that I might because stagnant. 2020 really did a number on my confidence in job hunting and how I'm perceived in the market because I was constantly turned down and overlook for things I felt like I was qualified for.
@hoanglam2814	So cool

@iyadmenla8409	Thank you Greg for all you do and dropping another review for us :)
@arsheyajain7055	Ohh checking it out now!! I’ve been waiting for your review!
@samueldioscoros2667	I took it and was impressed by it (this is Thomas Comerford btw, you responded to a comment of mine earlier today) in that it taught me a lot as a newbie. However, one thing that I noticed is that comparing it to the 4th course in the IBM cert, it doesn't utilize the requests library like the IBM one does. Personally, I think you're better off just skipping it if you're going to take the IBM courses, since the 4th course alone goes over everything and more that the specialization has. The only downside is that the IBM one is very fast paced, and it may feel like you aren't getting a total explanation of the content, so you'll just need to repeat stuff. One thing that you won't get in course 4 of the IBM cert is SQL with Python, but that's because it's another course.
@aryannegi3670	I am an absolute beginner with 0 programming knowledge. I want to learn python from scratch, which will also be my first programming language. What do you think I should be doing? the IBM one or the michigan one?
@sam1770	 @aryannegi3670  You should go for CS50's Hardvard one
@aritraghoshal8869	I have been thinking of opting for this one lately but I am constantly having second thoughts. Can anyone suggest a better course that would be of more value to a potential employer,

@ahmadnaveed4860	Hi Greg. I am completely new to the development world with background in sociology. No background in coding whatsoever. I have been wanting to start learning development for the past 2 years, but it is overwhelming not knowing where to start from. Can you please advise?

@Litehamer	I’m new to programming .  I tried CS50 but just don’t have enough time between work and family , for 2-3 hour lectures.  I’m considering this as may enhance my current role .   Is it genuinely beginner friendly?
@agustinrosinski8965	hi greg, i've just started the IBM data science professional certificate and I'm really excited about it, should I follow it with Andrew Ng's machine learning or deep learning specialization? I really like both but i can't tell which one is better
@agustinrosinski8965	 @GregHogg  thank you so much!
@nkosimaphumulo1979	The problem is that most python courses are just like this. Once you get the basics, it becomes very difficult to grow as a programmer through online courses. The best thing past learning the basics is doing a project, reading the documentations and getting good at copying code from stockoverflow.
@vincent4384	 @GregHogg  I'm a noob - I think i'll just learn this course on freecodecamp and use actual accomplishments afterwards as credit instead of taking the coursera cert
