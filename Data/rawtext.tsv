Stanford IBM and many many more they are 100we can start with our Coursera experience to summarize the sign and process we can say it's super easy and fast you register for free with an email or a Google or Facebook account and that's it to find your course you can use it or search bar and find specifically what you're looking for but if you want to do more in-depth research you can go to the Explorer page in case you don't know where to begin you can add personal information like where you work or what career you are pursuing will give you personalized suggestions forhorses that suit your skills and goals regarding our experience we wanted to take one of their most popular courses so we chose learning how to learn powerful mental tools to help you master through subjects on any courses main site you can find all the important details you need to know use a ratings approximate time to completion of bio and credentials of the instructors in a detailed syllabus with all the content included besides it's great reviews and beginner level status we chose this particular course because100 free with official certification included now that we have our course we can start with its lessons you can set how many days per week you can join so Coursera can track your progress and suggest more personalized due dates it's easy and intuitive and you have quick access to the content your grades the assignments and a resource section with more specific FAQs and extra reading material we really liked that their layout is very similar to a College's portal just like canva or Blackboardyou should start by watching the video lessons and then move on to the assignments the most common are quizzes and exams which can be integrated into the video lessons or be graded assignments that you'll find in each module to prove you've understood that weeks content then we have the discussion forums participating is not mandatory but you can check out if you want to share your Insight with the rest of the students or find relevant tips and stories that add valuable information to the coursefinally we have peer graded assignments which require you and your classmates to grade each other's work this is one of corsairs biggest issues as we mentioned course Sarah gives you suggested due dates there are no definitive due dates the course is 100% flexible how much you learn depends on your commitment and your desire to learn we recommend sticking to these due dates because the late submission can mean you won't be graded or have to wait more than you should quizzes are multiple choicewell that's done automatically but then you'll have to review some of your peers assignments while they grade yours the number of reviews each assignment needs depends on the course instructor and the average score of all the reviews will be your final grade if you follow their due dates and submit your work on time you'll likely get a grade within a week as other students usually review activities within three days of their deadline this way you'll need at least one review from your classmates even if the classis there multiple reviews now if you submit an assignment at least 3 days later than the suggested due date you'll need all the required peer reviews this is an issue because depending on how late you upload it there is a chance there won't be enough active users to grade your work in case you do this and there aren't enough active users to grade you you'll have to keep submitting your assignment until there are but the key takeaway here is that you are not being graded by an industry expert for ushaving someone with the same knowledge level reviewing your hard work won't have the same result as the one in experience Professor would give you rely 100% on how your classmates wants to grade you but aside from this creating issue Coursera is excellent lessons are interesting and easy to follow quizzes clearly test your knowledge and the discussion forums are filled with super helpful information on how to understand the course it was truly a great experience how much doeswhere is Heracross if you're willing to invest in their courses you can pay anywhere from $9.99 per month for guided projects and $49 to $79 per month for professional certificates and specializations but if you want to go to their college content Howard University issued certificates start at $2,000 per course well online degree programs begin at 9000 if you want to take advantage of their wide variety of top quality courses you have the option of4/0

Coursera Review  My Thoughts After 5 Years and 40 Online Courses	so I've mentioned Coursera in a handful of my videos as I believe it's one of the best ways to gain new skills and knowledge from some of the top universities in the world at an affordable price as low as free having been on Coursera for about the last five years and taken around 40 courses I've experienced it quite a bit and in this video I'll be doing a comprehensive review of the platform to help you get a better understanding of whatvalue Coursera can bring to you to help you skill up in advance your career so stay tuned hey folks Richard Wallace here and if we're meeting for the first time what this channel is all about is helping you with Career Development and personal finance so if those two topics or any interest to you I would highly recommend subscribing to this channel down below and hitting the notification Bell so you get notified when I post new content sowith that said let's talk about Coursera it's a little bit of backstory I started using Coursera around 5 years ago just a scope out exactly what it is they had to offer and what kind of Partnerships they had with different universities but there was one Topic in particular that I wanted to learn more about I was in the tech industry but one area that I just wasn't that familiar with was cybersecurity after searching a little bit I came across what Coursera terms as a specializationwhich is a series of courses within a subject and this one in particular was offered by NYU and I actually did a review on that course rather that specialization which you can check out in the description below short of it is I took these courses and I really enjoyed them I got a lot of value out of them so I ended up looking at what else could I learn and so I ended up taking some course work in iot Internet of Things after that actually useVera as part of my online MBA program through the University of Illinois and they've partnered with Coursera to use Coursera as a platform to deliver their video content and many of their assignments as a compliment or we could say in addition to the main course work that you do and the live sessions lectures that you actually attend online so Corsair is a compliment to that and from that I've takenthe majority of the courses of the 40 course that I mentioned so with that let me share with you what I think of the platform after 5 years 40 courses and I'll cover them in five areas first is variety of content second is University and organization Partnerships third is user interface 4th is community and fifth is career advancement as far as variety goes it's about as good as it getsis there has been around since 2012 and in that time they've developed a lot of Partnerships with like I mentioned earlier the top universities in the world to offer content and you can find just about anything you want to learn from arts and social sciences to business and engineering and everything in between so really runs the gamut now originally the platform only offered courses for free which of course they still dobut they've expanded that a little bit more to offer paid skill certificates and they've even partnered with universities to offer full-fledged masters degrees so really you have a lot of options from free to obviously the cost of a master's degree and a lot of content to choose from so what I just said ties into my next point which is the extent to which Coursera has really dove into Partnerships withwhat does universities but also organization some of the best companies in the world like Google and IBM to offer some additional content and paid certificates keep in mind the primary goal of Coursera is to make education accessible to just about anyone with a desire to learn and an internet connection and when it comes to accessibility of course there's plenty of free content you can get your hands on but one of the bigger disruptions that's happening in thevacation Market is that now more than ever there's more attention being paid to certificates or certifications in lieu of full-fledged degrees no I'm not discounting the importance of a full-fledged degree as of course Coursera has Partnerships with universities to offer a lot of these masters programs for a fairly affordable price but these certificates can serve as a really great supplement toyour knowledge and skill base and in some cases depending on the certification and Industry this can be a very viable path to a meaningful career change now I'll talk about career advancement towards the end of this video but the takeaway here is that Coursera has many Partnerships with not just universities but organizations as well to help deliver new content new coursework new certificates to again help you skill up nextis user interface and this is a little bit more subjective but to me it's probably the best user interface of any online learning platform that I've had to use and everything is relatively easy to navigate and find the course of themselves are fairly straightforward and easy to navigate as we have options to the left to move about the course content and the videos themselves have plenty of options for example they have closed caption that you can also increasethe the video speed if you're in a time crunch and they also have written transcripts which is very useful if you're trying to find certain keywords fourth area is community and when I say community it really refers to your ability to interact or collaborate with other students taking a certain course so this could be in the form of feedback that you provide to them and they back to you on certain assignments or also Q&A and fordiscussions so this is going to very quite a bit depending on how popular a course is and depending on the course itself and whether it lends itself to a lot of discussion in many courses you'll find that the assignments are either multiple choice which Course once you completed it's automatically graded you don't have to wait but then you'll also find open-ended questions which usually requires some kind of written response or you upload some documentlocation of some sort and the way that that's graded is that you submit your assignment and you in turn then grade three other assignments or the number can vary but let's say three or four assignments from other people that have also submitted their assignment you get a grading rubric so that's what you work off of and in return whatever you submitted is graded by other folks so you get some of that feedback as wellspeaking this kind of Engagement although the idea is nice that you have this kind of feedback loop with peers in the course it's typically not all that helpful because in many cases you'll find that other students may be in a hurry to just simply grade their assignments so they can get their grade and so they'll just write very does not going to be a whole lot of commentary there in many cases there's not going to behow much of anything of substance in this again may depend on the course but in my experience this has never really been that helpful to me now apart from the assignments every class has a discussion forum and I'll reiterate again that it really depends on the subject matter and also the popularity of the course that determines how much engagement they're actually is in the discussion forum so for exampleone of the most popular courses on Coursera is by Andrew NG and it's on machine learning and Andrew is actually one of the co-founders of Coursera and this is one of the oldest courses on there and as a result of its popularity there's plenty of discussion you'll have tens of thousands of threads and a lot of discussion going on about the class the content a lot of Q&A back and forth so it's a very vibrantTrinity in that course and then with other courses many other courses you'll have literally no discussion so again to the extent that any kind of community engagement or collaboration can happen will ultimately depend on the course last year is career advancement which is presumably why you're here in the first place to learn more about Coursera and how can help you simply put Coursera can absolutely help and I'll actually share with you a story here in a moment but theit helps is through their paid certificates or degrees so the Baseline here for Coursera as you now know is that they offer courses for free and you can complete them but you don't have any proof that you actually completed them unless you pay for the certificate was just means that when you complete the course content Coursera actually verifies it they verify your identity they verify that you completed the course andcompleted you have verifiable backing to actually include this course in the certificate on LinkedIn or on your resume now these certificates and specializations aren't necessarily replacements for full-fledged degrees which you can find on Coursera but they offer a really good way to supplement your skill and knowledge base and enough so that you can use these depending on how well you mark it yourself you can use these to helppivot your career or Advance your career so to give you a personal anecdote of mine and how certificates helped me in my career I'll go back to the time that I took some of the iot The Internet of Things courses and at that point in time I elected to pay for the certificate of completion to verify that I did it and at that point in time I didn't have necessarily a vision for what that might turn into I just because it was relatively inexpensive I went ahead andpaid for the certificate just so I would have it well as luck would have it sometime after that it might have been many months later maybe later in the year an opportunity opened up in the organization to be a product manager for our iot platforms and while I had great experience as a product manager I didn't have any experience with iot however having taken these iot courses insing a verified certificate that I actually completed this it gave me a little bit of an advantage to show the manager that I had a legitimate interest in this field and I took concrete steps to educate myself further on the topics and this turned into an advantage that I wouldn't otherwise have had so the opportunity for career advancement is certainly there even with just the certificates not to mention the degreesalso pursue which are far more clear paths to career advancement so folks check out Coursera down in the link below go find a corus or a subject that you're interested in take some classes for free and when he gets to a point where you're a little bit more serious and want to take more concrete steps that's when you should explore some of the paid certificate options on courses or specializations and of course if you have maybe a little bit more time and more financial backingcertainly explore some of the degrees that they have I will say that the degrees that they offer their in partnership with many universities are typically a fraction of the cost of many other masters degrees so again you're getting a really good value no matter which way you go there's no better time to skill up then now and I hope this video gave you a little bit of motivation to check out this fantastic platform to help you advance yourso thank you for watching and I'll see you around

3000 programs about all different topics because their partnered with over 200including big institutions like Yale in Google programs are truly affordable even though the amount you will spend depend on the courses that you choose first we have free courses which work as introductions the only downside is that these courses don't include completion certificates starting with the paid forces we have the guided projects which start out at $9.99 and only take one to two hours to complete as most of them are tutorials on how to use a specificadd or software on to the next level we have professional certificates and specialization forces these can last up to 6 months and teach how to develop specific valuable skills for a working environment both types of programs start at $39 per month if you're looking for college level education they have Master Tracks certificates and these begin at $2,000 per course and take less than a year to complete giving you a university issued certificate and credit that can lead you40 degree and if you want to earn a bachelor's or master's degree you can do it on Corsair with an online degree programs which start out at $9,000 a fraction of what it costs in traditional universities so why do we recommend Coursera well mainly because they have a bachelor's and master's degree program recognized by prestigious institutions overall Coursera is an excellent option for any non-traditional student who wants to accelerate their journey and pay much less for itnext up we have skillshare we have the perfect platform for Creative students what's great about skillshare is that they offer a subscription-based plan skillshare premium costs $32 per month for $168 if you go for the annual subscription while you are subscribed to skillshare premium you will be able to access all of the courses on their site they're an excellent option for academic courses with over 3000 programs about all different topics but if you're not sure if it's for you you can useare 7-Day free trial first and see what their courses have to offer their biggest cons though are that they don't give you an official certificate after you finish even if it's a premium course plus they don't have any Partnerships with the universities and their programs are just not University level meaning you can't use their credits as transfer credits into an actual accredited institution but we must say that skillshare is a multi-language site unlike most online platforms they coverespanol Francais German in Portuguese by translating their website to each of these languages and offering subtitles for all of their courses why do we recommend skillshare their subscription-based plan is an excellent option for Curious students who want to discover new skills they would likely never acquire anywhere else plus their pricing plans aren't too high considering all the knowledge that you have access to let me just ask you go ahead andsubscribe and share our Channel because simply YouTube likes it then if YouTube likes it then we can reach much more people who need this information just like you you to me with over 185,000 programs they have the biggest repository of high-quality courses plus each topic has a wide range of programs to choose from the price depends mainly on the instructor who leads the course not on the topic udemy Prices range from $11 to overput on average most courses cost between $80 and $100 before purchasing access to the course you can see all the content that's included before starting however if you buy it and you're not satisfied there is a 30-day refund available and just like Coursera once you finish a paid course you'll get an official certificate that proves your knowledge why do we recommend you to me it has an enormous quantity of specialized courses if you're looking to learn or improve a specifickill a new to me you pay once and then you have lifetime access to video tutorials you can go back to if you need them next up on our list we have the platform for students interested in stem fields that science technology engineering and math that platform is edx it's an educational platform for students who want to access high-quality courses and it was created by Harvard University and MIT members and they are also partnered with overMiss Universe FedEx offers over $3,500 courses now what makes edx different is it certification process most of their courses are free if you choose the free audit track you'll have temporary access to all course materials except for graded assignments you won't be able to complete the assignments nor will you receive a completion certificate which is what universities or future employers will ask you to show his proof of your knowledge to earn these certificates you have to paythe certificate fee which depending on the course caused between $50 and $300 but keep in mind that high-level classes may have higher prices however not all edx programs have the free audit track available here's the list with the types of certificates and whether you can do it for free or not why do we recommend edx because they have the recognition of many top universities and you can access a lot of their valuable content for free you still need to pay to earn the appcertificate but with it you'll have a valuable diploma that also works as transfer credit for your college to finalize the list we have LinkedIn learning with over $16,000 programs their main purpose is to educate and instruct the student while building and improving their LinkedIn profile which increases their chances of finding a better job position and establishing relationships with more professionals they have a subscription-based plan that once you pay for it you gain access to all the courses youLinkedIn learning subscription cost $39.99 per month or $320 per year but in case you have doubts they also have a 1-month free trial to try more in-depth all that they offer we're not going to lie their prices are a little bit higher than the other platforms but LinkedIn learning may be worth it if you're looking to expand the list of your professional contacts the biggest downside is that not all over their courses have the high quality overall standard thatonline platforms at perhaps you'll find more recognition with business and technology-related courses still you may not have the same luck with the programs focused on other fields like Arts humanity and social sciences which in comparison are much fewer so why do we recommend LinkedIn learning if you want to improve your business skills their courses in this field are much more well-developed and have a much more solid validity within institution's plus you'll further developthese are only some of the best and most popular platforms but there's more out there continue looking until you find the right one for you that's it for today if you've used any of the platforms that we've mentioned or just

Coursera Review The Best Elearning Site	hey guys Lewis here and in today's video I want to review Coursera so this is going to be a Coursera review Coursera if you don't know is a learning platform it's an e-learning platform but it is very different from other e-learning platforms like LinkedIn learning or other stuff and I'm going to talk about that in this video you can actually get professional certificates or you know even degrees actual you know National degrees bachelor's degrees or you know masterBreeze from accredited you know prestigious universities on Coursera while studying at home and so on so I'm going to talk about that as well now there are a few issues with Coursera specifically with the way it's sort of you know the assignments and stuff and it can be a bit expensive at time so I'm going to talk about that as well so first of all I'm going to talk about the pricing and at the same time I'm going to take this as an occasion to sort of walk you throughplay the different sort of features of Coursera and what you can expect so Corsair I was actually launched in 2012 by these two people Daphne and Andrew and so in 2012 you know I was around actually I was in college myself and I used Coursera as part of I think one or two of the courses that I attended at my University so you don't need to be in a university to usecall Sarah but some universities actually make use of Coursera to you know give their their their classes so of course Sarah they actually partner with a lot of top universities so I'm going to show you here there's a list of Partners I'm going to put a link in the description to all of the those universities it's not just universities they're also companies like you know AWS Amazon web services but you get a lot ofplay prestigious universities and in my opinion this is the main value proposition of Coursera you can actually you know take courses or even entire actual degrees from top universities from around the world you know from the comfort of your your home so for example here I'm on the I'm going to put a link to that in the description again so if you want to have this list and that's going to lead you to the courses and the degrees that these companies andclick the link in the description but here I'm going to look for you to Massachusetts at no way it was a Stanford actually Sanford has courses on Coursera you can go to you know Berkeley you can go to Caltech or you can go you know this is just for the United States but if I go to United Kingdom then you'll see that there is a Cambridge there is Oxford as well solaunch a very prestigious universities are on there and you can take their courses for a fraction of the cost or even an entire degrees for a fraction of the cost you know from the comfort of your own home now courses on Coursera it depends on the course but a lot of them are actual university courses so depending on the program that you're in a role in for example you know here I have a list of courses I actually look forhow many courses which is a programming language I take a look here at all of the offerings and some of them are actual university courses like for example this year University of Michigan of Michigan this is a specialization so I'm going to talk about that a little bit later but this is a set of courses and some of these courses are actually credit eligible now you can use those course those the credits that youturn by completing those courses and their assignments and all that I'm going to talk about that you can use those credits to to and those credits are going to count toward an actual degree that you may get like a bachelor's degree or a master's degree you can transfer those credits is just like University credits all right now I'm going to talk about how much it costs depending on the program so you have six kinds ofprograms on on Coursera first of all you have the free courses here for example I have a course python for a data science AI in development and I do realize that I'm showing you a lot of tech-related courses but of course Sarah has offerings for all kinds of courses you know psychology marketing and so on it's just that I'm in text so that's what I'm showing you so this is a course for example and what you do actually is that you get videos and assignments andwhat is and you can pay at the end if you want a certificate that you completed that course and you can put that on your on your resume you also have to guided projects like this one for example again this is a tech-related course build an expense Tracker app in Django now the guided projects that's what they call them it's just a project they typically lasts for much less time so here it's 4 to 6 hoursand this is like a sort of a tutorial long tutorial to learn a specific skill and hear the pricing for this is going to be a lot less expensive it's going to be $9.99 per month it kind of depends you know the pricing is going to change over time I'm assuming so I'm going to put a link in the description so you can actually take a look at the pricing now you also have the specialization specializations for example hereyou know University of Michigan Django for everybody specialization specializations are going to take longer to be several months so you have two moms at 10 hours a week so it's a total of about 80 hours that you have to invest in this specialization here and the specializations are actually you know you get a certificate at the End by completing the assignments and this is going to cost you about 49do I have any nine dollars depends on the on the specialization but 49 to 79.00 for the specializations and they're also other programs which are which are kind of similar which are called you know a professional certificates so that's that's the pricing approximately again I'm going to put a link to the pricing page in the description because it's likely to change over time now one of the great things about Coursera is that you don'tI got you know like online courses and specializations and stuff like that if you want to get an actual college degree like a bachelor's degree or master's degree you can do that on Coursera there is a lot there are lots of degrees that you can get on on Coursera and you know the the you can it's pretty flexible you can do them from home and usually it's a lot less expensive than if you were to attend the actual University although you knowis there a lot of cases you know still there are some you know degree programs that are pretty expensive so it really depends but you can get first of all there are these they call them Master track so it's not a master's degree it's called a master track certificate this is kind of like the specialization thing I showed you before it's going to last probably a little bit longer so for example here in a University of Michigan Social Work Mass track certset for moms you know it's typically four to six months approximately and the difference with the professional certificates or the specializations is that here it's it's like a master's degree but it's partial so you get some of the credits actual college credits that you can use toward a degree and yeah so it's transferable you can do a master track and then completthe entire master's degree if if that's what you need so these are actual college credits all right now for you also have the actual degree so it's not a master track here it's a really a master's degree for example here from Berkeley master of advanced study and engineering and you have a bunch of other degrees you can be bashful degrees or masters degrees so typically as far as pricing goes it really depends on theprogram when it comes to actual degrees for example here you know Berkeley this master's degree here is going to be 42,000 in total so it's pretty expensive if you want to take you know individual courses again it's going to vary but you should expect about $2,000 per course and you're going to get the college credits for for these courses typically for thewhat degree programs like bachelor's degrees or master's degrees I would say you have to you know have a budget of at least like 8000 and again it really depends on the University now there's another offering as well with Coursera if you're not necessarily interested in the you know actual like college degrees there's something called Coursera plus I'm going to put a link to that in the description but I feel likeplay pretty good offering I recommend that you start with that if you don't know where to start because it gets you access to thousands of courses and specializations and certifications I don't know about the specializations but definitely like the certifications and the courses you have access to all of these in a subscription package I think it's like $59 a month but you can get a 7-Day free trial if you click the link in the descriptionput a link to the free trial it's $59 a month and $399 per year if you choose to do it yearly so that's what I recommend you start with now I'm going to give you my own experience my own opinion of like using Corsair on the day on a daily basis you know back when I was in college and sort of my own opinion of the whole website now Coursera is very easy to sign up for it's just likewhat's the normal website there's no like paperwork or anything it's not like a university you can find a specific courses very easily on the you know if you go to the homepage here you can just type something for example I want to learn JavaScript which is a programming language and then it's going to display all of the you know courses and specializations and so on and even degree programs that I can sign up for or you can go to theare here and explore set of the different subjects and obviously you know tech-related stuff is pretty popular but you also have a bunch of other stuff that you can get into now when you go on an individual sort of course or specialization page for example I'm going to click on here which is a course by Mehta you know formally Facebook and this is going to show me a bunch of informationlike the reviews the the recommended experience the time to complete and the schedule and most of the time for the schedule it's going to be pretty flexible so you can complete the course or the specialization at your own at your own pace and they're not going to be any kind of hard deadlines and I'm going to talk about that in a second so once you sign up for a course you will actually get accessyou know like an interface like this where you have usually it's you know the course material is divided by week and you have access to all of the content here the you know the video content most of the time it's you know a bunch of videos but then it's intertwined with a bunch of assignments and a bunch of quizzes as well or a bunch of reading assignments as well so they're going to link you towhat page is that you have to read and so on are you will also have as I said at the end of videos usually you have quizzes to test your understanding of the video so this is you know you get the results instantly but you get also graded assignments which usually happen at the end of module so at the end of the week you get a great assignments it's going to test your understanding and I'm going to talk about that because this is kind of an issue of course Sarahbut you also get like discussion forums which are you know forms where you can ask questions and I find this very useful when you get stuck on a specific you know video or a specific assignment you can go to the discussion forums and usually you'll find people who have had the same issue as you've had or you can ask the question now let's talk a little bit about the assignments which is in my opinion it's a bit of an issue on Coursera and I thinka lot of people have noticed that the assignments are peer graded meaning that you know the other people taking the course are going to grade your assignments and you are going to grade the assignments of other people taking the course so the good thing here is that it's flexible right you can there's no hard deadline for assignments you can do them whenever you want and your assignment is typically going to be reviewed within aand by multiple people the number of people that is required to review your assignments it depends on the course I think it's the instructors that sat sort of the okay we need to reviewers per assignment or I think that's how it works and your grade on the assignment is going to be the average of all those reviews so typically as I said you should expect a grade in about a week andI recommend that you actually stick with the due date even though it's flexible the problem here is that if you submit an assignment more than 3 days late then you're going to need more people reviewing your your assignments to actually get it you know validated so the problem also is that if you're a very late when you submit an assignment you may not actually get enough peopleyou and your assignment so you're going to have to wait and keep on submitting your assignment until they're enough reviewers to review assignment and actually validate it and the biggest problem here with Corsair in general I would say is that the assignments are peer review their peer graded so you don't actually get like a course assistant like when you go to a brick and mortar University the assignmentsdid or the test exams are graded by actual unit Assistance or by the professor him or herself and so you get access to that kind of expertise but in the case of Coursera you know it's going to be pure graded so you're not going to get access to actual you know experts which is kind of the problem but at the same time you know like of course Sarah you get access to courses from top universities at a fraction of the cost so thatis to be expected right so there's no there's just no way around it so that's pretty much it this was my review of Coursera once again I'll put all the interesting links in the description especially Corsair plus if you want to check it out there's a 7-Day trial and that's it I'll see you in the next video
Palo Alto Networks Cybersecurity Professional Certificate Review  Coursera	what's going on guys it's Moda same here and today we will be reviewing a Palo Alto networks cybersecurity professional certificate offered by Palo Alto networks this program is offered on Coursera and is designed to provide Learners with essential skills in cybersecurity networking and Cloud security if you are entering the field of cybersecurity an IT professional looking to Pivot into cybersecurity or preparing for entry-level roles such as cybersecurity analysts NetworkEngineers or security operations center analysts then this program might be for you the professional certificate consists of four courses that cover a range of fundamental cybersecurity topics the first course is foundations of cybersecurity in this course you will have an introduction to cybersecurity fundamentals key Concepts like threat vectors and defensive strategies Additionally you will learn basics of networking and system security principles thefirst comes with video lectures readings PDF attachments and a final quiz to assess your knowledge the second course is network security fundamentals remember that completing each course qualifies you for a certificate of completion remember that these courses prepare you for Palo Alto networks certified cybersecurity entry-level technician okay back to it in the second course you will Deep dive into securing networks basics of security operations centerPoint Security the course also has interactive tutorials beside the readings and the lecture videos to pass this course you will need to complete the final quiz the third course is cloud security fundamentals again remember that these courses prepare you for Palo Alto networks certified cybersecurity entry level technician so here you will have a comprehensive look at Cloud security and overview of securing applications and data in Cloud environments using Prisma Cloud by Paulonetworks and an introduction to Cloud infrastructure Security Management the course also has interactive tutorials beside the readings and the lecture videos to pass this course you will need to complete the final quiz the fourth final course is Palo Alto networks security operations fundamentals so here you will learn the skills needed for working in a Soc environment well at least you will learn the theory Additionally you will learn about sore seem Next Generation firewallsincident response the course also has interactive tutorials beside the readings and the lecture videos to pass this course you will need to complete the final quiz and after this course you will earn the full professional certificate all right I skipped a very important aspect and probably you might be wondering why this program used to have two courses with Hands-On labs and access to Palo Alto firewall graphical user interface through NDG Labs but unfortunatelycontent of these courses isn't available anymore the current available courses don't have access to NDG Labs therefore you will get to learn about Palo Alto internal components and the user interface through the lecture videos and the interactive tutorials at the end though it may not be as popular as CompTIA Security Plus or GI Security Essentials but it's a good start especially if you're planning to work in a security Operation Center environment where they use plow Alto and GFplay firewall for security and monitoring all right let me know your thoughts in the comments have a nice weekend
ONLY UNSPONSORED Review of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate From Coursera	I'm sure you've seen the videos making significant claims about the Google cybersecurity certificate and how amazing it is but are they really telling the truth I have literally not seen one video reviewing the Google cybersecurity certificate that wasn't sponsored by either Google or Coursera and honestly it's very clear in those videos that they have a ton of bias in them forget that I'm going to give you my honest perspective on the certificate in the only review video that isn't sponsored and trust me they really try but I kept declining theirso it's pretty likely that if you have any interest in cybersecurity that you've heard about the Google cybersecurity certificate it's fairly new to the certification or training game in the industry but of course it has the name Google attached to it so people are automatically going to give it some credibility if we look at what they say on the website it says it's going to prepare you for a career as a cyber security analyst with a professional certificate from Google learn job ready skills that are in demand like how do I identify common risks threats and vulnerabilities as well as the techniques toyou don't need prior experience to qualify for the certification and it's provided entirely online with on-demand training which means that you can go at your own pace some of the jobs they say you can qualify for after you complete the program or cyber security analyst security analyst sock analyst information security analyst it security analyst and cyber defense analyst additionally they talk about when you complete the certificate you'll get exclusive access to Career Circle to help finding jobs but when I actually Google this service says they don't charge anybody anyways this aspect isoutside of the scope of what we're going to talk about in this video but I do find that pretty interesting before we dive deeper into this video I just want to show you that I have actually gone through this program and completed the certificate if we scroll down here you'll see my main certificate for the entire program we'll see the different courses and see that I've completed every single one of them with 100% score the reason why I show you that is because some people are talking about the program without ever having looked at it deeper and the majority of the peopleI'm talking about it definitely didn't complete the certificate that's not me though because I did it all right now that's out of the way let's talk more about the actual training aspect for starters there's eight different courses that are included with the certificate all right so we're on the certificate website if we scroll down we'll see the courses that are included with the certificate so first of all it starts out with foundations of cybersecurity this talks about recognizing core skills and knowledge needed to become a cyber security analyst identify house security tax impact business operationsexplain security ethics identify common tools used by cybersecurity analysts you're going to learn to identify the primary threats risks and vulnerabilities to business operations examine how organizations to protect business operations Define commonly used security information and event management or Sim tools and use a Playbook to respond to threats risks and vulnerabilities of course three is connect and protect networks and network security you're going to Define the types of networks andillustrate how data is sent and received over Network understand how to secure network against intrusion tactics and describe system hardening techniques next course is tools of the trade Linux and sequel you're going to learn to explain the relationship between operating systems applications and Hardware compare graphical user interface or GUI to a command line interface navigate and manage the file system using Linux commands via the bass shell and use sequel to retrieve information from a databasenext course is assets threats and vulnerabilities you're going to learn to classify assets analyze and a tax service to find risks and vulnerabilities identify threats such as social engineering malware and web-based exploits and summarize the threat modeling process next one Sound the Alarm detection of response you're going to identify the steps to contain eradicate and recover from incident learn to analyze packets to interpret network communication understand basic syntax components of signatures and laws intrusion detectionsystems IDs and network intrusion detection systems needs tools and you're going to perform queries and security information and event management or Sim tools to investigate an incident next course is automating cybersecurity tasks with python you're going to learn to explain the Python programming language and how it's used in cybersecurity you're going to learn to create new user to find python functions you're going to learn to use regular Expressions to extract information from text and you're going to practice debugging code and the final course is putting it to work prepwhat type of security jobs you're going to determine how and when to escalate a security incident you're going to learn to engage with a cyber security Community you're going to learn about finding and applying to cyber security jobs and you're going to prepare for job interviews so you can see that sounds like a pretty tall order for a lot of these courses to accomplish now let's talk about what each course includes first of all it has videos led by Google instructors to teach New Concepts introduced the use of relevant tools offer career support and provide inspirational personal stories you're going to get readings to build on the topdiscussed in the videos introduce related Concepts share useful resources and describe case studies there's discussion prompts to explore course topics for better understanding and allow you to chat and exchange ideas with other Learners in their discussion forums you're going to get self-review activities and labs to give you Hands-On practice and applying the skills that you're learning and allow you to assess your own work by comparing it to a completed example now you can theoretically say that you did these and just keep moving they don't actually validate it there's interactive pluginsencourage you to practice specific tasks and help you to integrate knowledge that you've gained in the course you get Nvidia quizzes to help you check your comprehension as you progress through each video you get practice quizzes that allow you to check your understanding of key Concepts and provide valuable feedback and you get graded quizzes that demonstrate your understanding of the main concepts of a course you have to score 80% or higher on each grade quiz to obtain the certificate and you can take a great quiz multiple times really as many as you want to get a passing scoredon't limit the overall amount of times but they do require that you only take it a maximum of three times in 24 hours also the quizzes aren't proctored so you can just take them whenever you want if you're enjoying the content so far make sure to leave a like so that YouTube knows you enjoy the content also that it's helpful for other people make sure to check out the description for more resources related to this video and let's get back to the content all right so let's talk about what it takes to actually get the certificate first of all you have to take all eight courses you have to pay the course certificate fee so course Sarah costsfind dollars per month or $399 per year the estimate that the certificate is going to take you about 6 months if you study 7 hours per day so that's roughly about $294 if you pay monthly now keep in mind that when I completed everything in about 4 days it actually just a word of me the certificate without forcing me to pay so I'm not really sure if that's an actual requirement you also have to complete all these assignments there's no penalty for late assignments so if you skipped over something and then you came back and then you did it againbig deal us have to pass all the great quizzes in all eight courses with a score of 80% or better so now I want to shift gears and talk about each one of the courses in this certificate of course one is foundations of cybersecurity now typically any certificate certification or training course starts out with an introductory section that way you don't get overwhelmed right out of the gate this is no different I actually don't mind starting with this basic information but the information that was included in this section is probably way more basic than you need to actually get started another problem I have with thisis front introduction course I expect there to be a discussion about court or foundational information like how networks operate none of that kind of information was discussed in this section and that's a huge mess in my eyes this is a typical student is going to have very little knowledge when they first start out of course who is play it safe manage security risks something that you'll see in many of the courses and what's covered in this program uses something called the cisp exam domains to drive the discussion I'm not saying that the domains aren't accurate in the cisp but theybasically start drifting your attention to another certification that's much higher level right away in the course you'll learn more about threats risks and vulnerabilities and that's always a good discussion this course also introduces security Frameworks like the nest RMF or risk management framework and Oasis finally things wrap up talking about the incident response process just like with the first course everything is conceptual and you still don't get exposure to the foundational information that I would expect of course three is connect and protect networks and network security Now this section starts goingend of some of the tcpip knowledge that you need and more lab exercises are required the labs are all document-based like reading a raw Network log but there's no hands on experience with tools course Force tools of the trade Linux and sequel up to this point there are definitely issues with the program and it really doesn't get any better what are the major problems that I saw with this course is there's a huge focus on the Linux operating system and literally a sense or two talking about windows are you kidding me when is one of the most widely adopted operating systems of organizations that you're going to have to protectand they barely even mentioned it in passing it's literally like they tried to shove sequel into this section to disguise the fact that they don't talk about windows at all it must be because Google hates Microsoft or something but seriously what a joke at least they give you a few Hands-On examples with Linux they also mention Kali Linux here but they don't show you anything about it so it's just another word to you of course 5 is assets threats and vulnerabilities this course spends a lot of time talking about asset classification rolls regarding data Oasis and the pasta threat model framework Iplay expect this section to be crazy in depth for beginner certificate so I have no issue really either way course 6 is Sound the Alarm detection and response this course is all about incident response luckily there are some Hands-On Labs where you can use tools like Wireshark Splunk and a few others the labs themselves are very beginner level but this is one of the better courses of this program because you actually get exposure to the tools of course 7 is automate Cypress Security tasks with python overall in my eyes this is the best horse from this program you'll learn the basics of python including writingdo you think Python scripts and how to debug them my major concern with python throughout this course is a Google is embedded a strong impression that python is a skill that you won't be successful unless you have they really try to convince you of this and that's dangerous for people that are new to the industry because frankly that's not true additionally they really overload this section which further emphasizes the idea that python is mandatory in cybersecurity what are you doing Google seriously is put it to work prepare for cyber security jobs something that they do in this course that's not alwaystalked about or covered is escalations I think that's actually an important discussion to have with newer or more Junior people so I appreciate that they also talked about the star method for interview questions and how to develop a resume although I have very strong opinions on topics like these I think it's a positive thing to at least include content on them in general what's covered is fairly basic in this course question of the day why do you want to work in cybersecurity let me know down in the comments section below all right at the moment you've all been waiting for what's my opinion on the Google cybersecurity certificate honestly belongplay Trash although there's some things that I can appreciate in this course it's really one of those things that they would have to recreate to even get close to getting my seal of approval they don't do a good job of teaching in the core knowledge that you need they completely ignore the Windows operating system they overemphasize the need for python to be successful and other issues that at this point aren't worth talking about because of those glaring issues additionally employers aren't asking for the certificate and Google themselves even tries to push you towards the security plus next which is way more valuable certificationplay unemployment standpoint I just don't know why vendors keep trying to push cyber security certifications as the first step when it relies heavily on knowing the foundational information first it makes no sense if you use logic as always make sure to leave a like comment and subscribe to

you can tell them about you so you can currently say that I'm currently a software developer or engineer that way they'll give you courses based on yourinformation that you give them so over here as you can see down below we have these three courses over here so so we have a free course from you which is managing emotions and time and uncertainty and stress by Yale University and then we have a psychology course which is free from Toronto to University and then we have a covid-19 training in healthcare from Stanford and then we have writing in science from Stanford as well and as you can see we have quite a lot of courses which are free so it's pretty amazing andwhat's a good thing about this is that you can earn your degrees from a different levels so you can get a bachelor's degree you can get a master's degree in business in applied Arts and Science and apply data science like it's really amazing and then down below you have some certificates that you can also get so you have a ux design Master Tech certificate you have finance and analyst modeling certificate AI certificates data analytics managers and you have other courses as well so let's go ahead and see down below you as you can see over hereyou can explore other courses from Coursera so right off the bat let's go ahead and check out data science courses over here so as you can see over here you can either get degrees or courses which is pretty cool and they all offer free courses as well well not all courses like as you can see there are some courses that you have to apply for but if money is tight you can also send them an application and they'll try their best to you know lower them so as you can see over here we have a python data structure course from Michigan University soclick on this course right here as you can see over here we have quite a lot of things going on over here so as you can see this is what you will learn you will learn how to explain principles of data science create programs and write data files and store data Keys using python dictionaries and you can accomplish multi-step tasks like sorting or looping using two poles and the skills you will gain will be python syntax and semantics data structure Tuple and Python Programming and over here this is going toplay your instructor which is Charles Russell servants he is a clinical professor at Michigan University and then down below these are some of the reviews that people have given using Coursera so over here as you can see this person has said that it's that it's a very bad he has learned to pick up new ideas and quickly apply them to real world problems today my certificates make me stand out from the crowd which is pretty good and then if you scroll down below this is going to be your syllabus for the homeless semester and over here for the first week which isgoing to be a 4 hours course and over here you're going to be learning chapter 6 which is called strings and then we'll figure it is also a 3-hour course as you can see it's pretty amazing it's pretty simple and it keeps going on until you are completed your course and over here as you can see the reviews are pretty amazing so five star reviews a total 4.9 reading over 1500 people have reviewed this course which is pretty amazing that just shows you how good it is and then write down below you can enroll for free startingUber 28th

documents as I said before and as you can see over here over 795,000 people have already enrolled and you can audit this course for free when you audit a course this is a pretty amazing this is what I was about to tell you guys they have this feature called audit and from that you can basically apply for free on any course even if it's not free if it's a paid course or a master's degree or a bachelor's you can enroll in that course for completelyread through this audit so when you audit a course so when you order the course you can access the course material without graded assignments or the ability to earn a certificate that is the drawbacks so what that basically means is that you can enroll for free you can complete the course meaning you can get the entire syllabus and you will basically be a master in that course but you won't have a certificate to prove it for that for just that certificate you will have to pay which I think is fair in a way but you know if they're giving you aunderstand of course they're not going to provide you with a certificate if you want the certificate then you obviously have to pay for the course now that you've known about the syllabus now let's go ahead and check out some other things that I wanted to show you about and this is the thing that I wanted to show you the guided projects now these are going to be projects now they're basically projects but I don't call them projects because they are basically interactive courses that you can download them and then you can run the program on a virtual machine that they provide and then you can mess around with it you can play with all the coursesyou have so if you're learning programming then you could be able to download the application and you can access a virtual computer at Coursera headquarters and then you will basically be able to play around with all the programming even if your computer doesn't handle that that's the thing about where she'll computers you can access them anywhere you want which I think is a pretty cool thing so let's go ahead and take a look so over here as you can see over here your workspace is a cloud desktop right in your browser as I said before no download is required andScreen Video your instructor guides you step by step which I think is pretty amazing and down below this is going to be our instructor if we choose this course her name is Marcia Saha who is a PhD scholar and game theorist and over here she has over 7,000 Learners and she provides five courses and then you can go ahead and start your guided project but just simply clicking on the start guided project and over here as you can see you will have to pay $10.00 for this course which I think is fairnot too expensive you don't even have to use your computer they will basically provide you with everything and as I said it's pretty amazing it's really mind-blowing that you can get your University degrees from one of the top universities in the world right at your home and I think that's amazing now that we know that it's pretty good now let's go ahead and take a look at the pricing section so for the pricing sections you will have to get Corsair business so for the pricing sections over here as you can see for the teams you will have99 per users per year so for $400 a year you can learn any program that you want you can learn any course that you want which I think is pretty amazing you have two plans you have the team and you have the Enterprise for the Enterprise this for a larger organization of course they're going to have to contact sales for that but for the user one for the team ones for the smaller projects I think $400 is worth it and over here you will get access to over 4,000 courses from top universitiesadd access to guided project assessments and quizzes verified certificates upon your course completion as I said before which I think is pretty amazing and over here you get quite a lot of things and quite a lot of pros and cons so you can start your Coursera program anytime you want now if as I said before if money is tied then of course you can always go to the audit option as well as I said before it's pretty amazing like a couple of my friends have also used it and they also have benefited from the Coursera and asI said before people all around the world have been using Coursera and earning degrees and skills that they never thought they could achieve in just a matter of months and they're not even smaller degrees like we're talking about Master's degrees and bachelor's degrees in my opinion I think yes Coursera is worth it and people should definitely try it out so that is it for this for you guys I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please be sure to hit the like button subscribe to

Andrew Ng  AI for Everyone  COURSERA Review	here's my review of the course AI for Everyone by Andrew NG on Coursera this is a beginner course that serves as an introduction into what is artificial intelligence and how it can be used in practice with particular focus on the business world and I make videos about AI the course is designed for 4 weeks with very light load if you're super committed and properly caffeinated you can probably get through the whole thing in one day if you want the certificate of completion you have to pay $50 I would say if you make good salary you might as well pay for the certificate because your time is a lot more Valleyopen the certificate cost and just in case you would need in the future it's good to have it if money is tied for example a student don't worry about the certificate you can order the course for free and you will get the same value out of it after every week section there is a quiz which is really easy to pass if you have been paying attention to the material there's absolutely no coding in this class so if you already working on a machine learning project this class is not for you it's to beginner for you if you are a machine learning engineer this is a great course to recommend to the people you're working with so they can get quickly up to speed and you have toplay all the basic concepts to them yourself you can just put them to this course they can take it and they'll be able to communicate with you much better I think in few years course like this will be part of a general business curricula just like now when you join a company to take some management courses I think understanding AI in the future will be absolutely critical to the business function so this will be part of the Core Curriculum so everybody understands what AI can and cannot do and how to use the ethically and efficiently in week one it goes over general concepts and definitions for examplewhat is the difference between narrow artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence what is machine learning what is supervised learning there is also a lot of focus on data which is critical to get any machine learning project to work well in week two the business focus of this course becomes very evident during this whole week it talks about how to properly structure and AI project this is very nicely done since it allows non-ai people to start thinking at a high level about what is needed to practically execute an AI project it assumes that the technical parts of thefor example coding will be done by a different department either internally or externally in week 3 and represents couple simple case studies so you can see how an air project will work in practice there's also a really good explanation of different roles that might be needed to execute an AI project he explains the difference between software engineer machine learning engineer machine learning researcher data scientist data engineer and AI project manager in week 4 the content is probably the least useful from a practical perspective by goes into important isit's like bias in Ai and adverse use of AI in some parts the course is a little bit outdated and dimensions that degenerate cohesive text output is difficult for AI that is clearly not the case anymore since the release of language models like gpt3 and check over all this course is highly recommended for people just getting into AI thanks for watching I'll see you next video
Math for Machine Learning by Imperial  Coursera REVIEW	I recently completed the mathematics for machine learning specialization on Coursera from Imperial College London and I wanted to share my thoughts on it with you now this is a course that I paid for myself so it's an honest review about my experiences with this course what I thought about it and what I gained from it and whether or not I think it's worth taking the course so let's take a closer look there are three courses in this specializationdoes linear algebra multivariate calculus and PCA or principal component analysis the first course in the specialization is on linear algebra and its taught by Professor David die now David really is an exceptional teacher it covers vectors matrices and eigenvalues and eigenvectors but what David is able to do first of all he's able to relate the subject of linear algebra to data science and machine learning very effectively sowhy do you even need to learn in a linear algebra in order to be able to do machine learning and data science David explains that very well and he also gives really helpful intuition behind each topic that he covered David is one of those teachers that makes the subject seem easier than it actually is and you find yourself understanding it perhaps better than you did before or if you've come across these subjust before these topics before so I'd certainly recommend his teaching as far as the course itself goes the production values are very high the videos range from about 3 minutes to 15 or so minutes in length after the videos there are little quizzes now some of the courses that you get the quizzes are sort of trivial and easy on this specialization all the way through in all of the courses the questionsout all like that that there are some easy ones but there are some challenging ones you know where you have to sit through and work through that work out the solution with a with a pen and a piece of paper and it's not just an easy multiple choice and I found that those questions help my understanding of the topics that were covered at the end of each week at the sort of concluding part of each week and these courses range in length from sort of four five six weeks eachyou have an assignment to do and it's a programming assignment and again these weren't just trivial you actually had to think about them and I've seen some criticism in the course reviews on more than some of the reviews on Coursera that the the assignments were too difficult and that they didn't match the level of difficulty in the videos and the way subjects were covered in the videos but that's not truediamonds are challenging but you know that's how you learn and you might find yourself having to watch certain videos again or to research the subject in a little bit more detail just to make sure you really understand it but that's the whole point of the assignment if you can't do the assignment it really means you haven't understood the topic and that doesn't matter but just go away and understand it tried the assignment again and if you don't get it right you know become an iterativeguess you just keep trying to improve on what you've done and trying to get a better and deeper understanding of the subjects that have been covered favorite part of the linear algebra course was the section on eigenvalues and eigenvectors because it gave some really useful intuition on their use and applications when working with data so watch out for that if you do the course because I think you'll really like it the second course of the specialization ismy Sam Cooper now Sam is another fantastic teacher again he's able to break topics down complex topics and really make them seem much simpler than they are this second course is on multivariate calculus but it starts at the very basics of calculus it shows you how to calculate a gradient using calculus and then builds up from there to multivariate calculus and the section onorganization where you use gradient descent for optimization was really excellent and there was some exercises there that gave you again gave you really useful intuition on why these methods work and what you're actually doing and that's why I think this course is so valuable because it really does give you the inside that you need to be able to understand what's going on in many of the well-known machine learning algorithms and I think that reallyplay thumbs up the philosophy of this whole specialization they're trying to give you insight into the maths so that you understand why it's used and and how it works rather than focusing on learning how to for example calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues now when I was first taught these subjects a long time ago we focused on you know how do you actually come up with the right answer if you're trying to calculateand you might be able to calculate those answers but you might not understand what you're actually doing where is this sort of turns it around it says well don't worry about calculating it because you've got computers to do that actually understand what's going on and that's what this course focus is on but it's still gives you exercise to do an assignments to do where you have to use that understanding in order to get the right answer part 3 the Finalwhat's in this specialization is on principal component analysis now principal component analysis PCA is a dimensionality reduction method it's really essential when working with the data especially if you've got large data sets it's a bit like you know compression for data and this is probably out of the three the weakest course now that's not to say that it's not good the previous two courses have set the standard so high thatit's you know it makes it a little bit unfair for this course the instructor is Mark Peter dies and Roth he's very good he clearly knows his subject he just doesn't seem to have the same ability to connect with the viewer as the previous two instructors but still you will learn a lot from this course and it's still a well put together a well explained course andplay the exercises are used for and by the end of it you will understand PCA and when to use it and why it's useful now who's this course for well if you've never covered these subjects before if you haven't studied maths before then this course is for you if you want to learn machine learning or understand machine learning a little better if you're new to the subject but if you haven't covered any of these topics before you will find this a challenging courseif you've never seen any linear algebra before you know vectors and matrices you will find it challenging if you've never done calculus before you will find it challenging challenging but doable this won't be Beyond you but it will require work and maybe extra reading and maybe a few extra exercises on topics that you don't understand now the key is don't gloss over things that you don't understand don't think well I don't understand that but I'll leave it and I'llstop at that point and make sure you understand it do some reading around the subject and that way I think you know you'll make it to the end of the course and you will get a lot from this course and your insight into the subject will be far far greater than it would have been prior to taking this course and you know beginners I'm sure can definitely make it all the way through the course get the certificate and then move on to learn more about machine learning you'll need a little bit ofparents using python as well so if you've never programmed with python before maybe learn a little bit about that first and get some experience doing that you don't need loads but just so that you've seen it before you might also be coming to this course Having learned these subjects before but you know they're pretty Rusty so perhaps if you've done a science degree some kind of Science degree in the past and you're used to these Concepts but for example you've used vectors to model real world situationphysical situations rather than data then this would also be a useful course for you I really like this course I think it's one of the best courses that I've seen on this subject and what it does is take them all the mess that you need or a lot of the math that you need for the main maths that you're likely to need to understand machine learning and put it all in one place the instructors are superb and I'd really recommend it

entertaining way make it one instead of boring and in return I just asked to like this video And subscribe to my channel if you enjoyed the content I make that's all right now that's you know what it's all about let's have a look at the certification Program full stopwhat is made up of 12 horses they are introduction to cloud computing introduction to web development with HTML CSS and JavaScript getting started with Git and GitHub developing front end apps with react developing begins with no gas and express python for data science Ai and development development AI application with Spider-Man mask Django application development with security and databases introduction to Containers Docker kubernetes and openapplication development used in microservices and serverless and full stop Cloud development Capstone project this full stack software developer assessment as you see photos this is quite a well-structured Wars that offers some serious Knowledge and Skills the course description says is beginner friendly and after I look at some students feedback I can say that it's really so however I would still recommend getting to know some Basics like HTML CSS and JavaScript that waymake sure you'll learn English what I also like about this course the Practical side of it because this course serious offers Some solid heads on experience the Practical projects cover a variety of training Technologies and programming languages in Full Stop Cloud application development and here is something you will be working on HTML pages on cloud object storage and interest rate calculator using HTML CSS and JavaScript and I programplay on cloud Foundry using the word principles and cicd to change the snow SQL database and there are many other apps you will be able to build using all kinds of Technologies like not react python darker kubernetes Django bootstrap and others pricing and certification okay now let's talk about the cost yes this course is not free but when you consider the extensive curriculum Capstone projectswhat's the ability of IBM certification it's a worldwide investment especially if you are very serious about a full stack development carrier besides Coursera understand the importance of informed choices that's why it provided a 7-Day free trial and this way students can explore the course content before deciding on a pay subscription okay you might ask Daniel what about certification and in this case I'm happy to tell you that once you complete the program and all these projectsyou will get a courser certificate of completion but I think most importantly here you will get a professional certificate from IBM and the page that you can easily add to your LinkedIn profile or resume and guy that could be a way to catch the eye of potential employers career opportunities speaking of job opportunities completing this courses you have for a junior position in Full Stop development once you have earned the certificate and completed all the projects you canconfidently apply for jobs because these certification program truly opens doors for a promising career and that's something to be excited about bad guys it was remembering that it won't give you a golden ticket to high pain position straight away I think some solid in the river preparation will definitely help student reviews all right and now let's look at the feedback this professional certificate received from students and from what I have seen the majority ofhow old is the score serious students are not in its detailed curriculum Hands-On projects and top match teaching style learner seem to enjoy diving into practical projects where they can actually use the skills they have picked up as these five star review says I'm totally new to the it filled so initially I was really nervous however the instruction has been great and if things very simple and in increments report the information was really easy to digestthe ability to say no directly from a video and written presentation is a great too this gave learner the flexibility to move through the material and picking and saving pertinent notes without compromising time but I found some criticism too people feel like some parts of the course like detailed explanations which might be difficult for beginners other sometimes complain about the quality of the video decent course I justfind it frustrating and strange that so many introductory Concepts and foundational topics are overlooked and Skip through the course for example they were a lot of important terms that I believe are crucial to explain such as what is the server what is the network what is the data center and what is a system in it even though I have no problems with learning about the storms are on my own I feel like the course would help more than that and more meaningful if theredefinition for Learners to build on is IBM full stack developer certificate worth it all right guys now let's get down to it here is my opinion on whether you should invest time and money in this course serious and in this case my answer is yes why not I think this is one of the best full stop courses on Coursera platform at the moment and not only of course Sarah on all platforms that's why I say this course are expertsyes sometimes you will have to read additional materials bad guys this is Scott learning looks like the course is well structured and it can significantly boost your chances of getting a job all right my fellow developers that's all about IBM's full stop software developer professional certificate on Coursera I left in the description below so feel free to check them out don't forget to like this video if you enjoy my content and subscribe for more videos like this thanks for

Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera  Review	what's going on everybody welcome back to another video today we're going to be taking a look at the machine learning specialization on Coursera needs no introduction but if you have not heard of him is the co-founder of course Sarah the very platform today he was also the co-founder and the head of Google brain so this guy knows what he's talking about and he is extremely intelligentbecause he is the creator of this machine learning chorus but he created it back in 2012 but this one that we're going to be looking at today is a revamped updated and more enhanced version of the one that he originally created and we're going to be diving into the courses so you can see what you're actually going to get if you decide to take this course but from everything I've seen is absolutely phenomenal one of the biggest upgrades that they made from the original course that they changed the programming language that they used in it originally they were using a programming language called octave and now they're usinghuge upgrade now I'm a data analyst and my audience is mostly data analyst as well so you may be wondering why we're even looking at machine learning specializations cuz that's more data science well one of the biggest things that I usually tell people is that you may not use machine learning as a data analyst but you're going to be working with people who do use it and so understanding how it works understanding the terminology behind it can really help you go a long way and it really helps me out aboutand all these different things that they were doing and I feel like actually knew what they were talking about and I could kind of keep up with them it was really beneficial to at least know the basics of machine learning now before we jump on my screen and start taking a look at the specialization I want to give you a shout out to these sponsor of this video and that is of course Sarah's one of the best platforms just about anything data-related so if you want to learn SQL all the way to machine learning you can do that on course Sarah or if you want to become a data analyst a datalist or a data engineer you can do all of your learning right here on Coursera it has been one of my favorite platforms to learn on for the past five years since I became a data analyst and I still love it today thank you again to call Sarah for sponsoring this video and without further Ado let's jump on my screen and take a look as you can see on my screen this is the machine learning specialization it is brought to you by deep learning.ai and Stanford both things that are associated with Andrew and now there are a few other instructors on here but Andrews the one who's actually doingalmost every single one of the videos go through all the math walks through everything and I mentioned him specifically because he's just such a huge name in machine learning and artificial intelligence he's just incredibly popular and you know the original course they did back in 2012 was like a staple in the machine Learning Community I mean just about everybody who got started walk through it and it's just because he's so smart and he talks about it so wellif you haven't taken his original one this new one is just enhanced it just goes above and beyond without original one did so if you haven't taken it and this is like the time to take it and I'm going to give you a spoiler it's amazing and so with that being said let's jump into it so it just came out like a couple weeks ago from when I'm recording this like the middle of June is when it came out and you're going to learn a ton of stuff in here right down here you're going to build a machinehow many miles a numpy in sidekick learn building training you work mostly with supervised learning Andrew goes a little bit into the unsupervised learning as well but he'll even tell you he primarily is looking at linear and logistic regression those type of machine learning models so that this is like I would say the nuts and bolts of what you're going to learn he teaches you about the best practices for machine learning development how to train neural networksusing tensorflow and tensorflow is fantastic if you've never used it and he goes really in-depth into all these things like none of these are just like brushed off or like the basics he goes like really in-depth and almost all these things as well as recommendation systems and how they work and the math behind them and everything it's really fascinating now one thing I want to mention before we get into like the actual course is that he goes into a lot of math if you don't know the math behind this stuff that is okay in fact it'spretty common for most people who take this to not understand the math behind it and he talks about that in one of his videos he's like Hey listen the map behind this is really important but it doesn't mean you have to go and be able to do the math just maybe understand that some of the concepts and it's true a lot of this math is really Advanced and so again that's why it's like if you aren't going into machine learning and you don't need all this math still walking through these videos and understanding these Concepts I mean it isphenomenal let's go down really quickly to the courses there's three courses the biggest one is the supervised machine learning regression and classification again that's all supervised machine learning the second course is the advanced learning algorithms this one's very Hands-On so it's a lot of building the models understanding how to train your models and things like that and then we have the third chorus which this one has not been released yet as of when I'm recording it although it may be when I release thisit may be available but this goes into the unsupervised learning recommenders and reinforcement learning so again the bulk of what's the original course and this is built on and what you are going to learn is the supervised machine learning the logistic and linear regression that is what this is primarily focused on but the third chorus is on kind of the other things that are still popular just not as heavily used like unsupervised learning and recommendation systemsso let's go and take a look at this first course and see what is actually in there all right if we take a look at Week 1 this is basically Andrew kind of walking you through the basics Andrew was like the ideal Professor I mean just look at him he's just like the happiest guy and you can tell he just loves what he does he's just like that professor in college that you want to take his chorus or his class over and over again but you already passed through such a good teacher that's how Andrew is this entire time he's just afantastic teacher and he teaches it extremely well so in this first week you're going to go through the supervised and unsupervised learning just what are what is it how does it work and the math behind it and then he's going to introduce Jupiter notebooks now most of these videos whoops most of these videos are exactly like how he has them right here so he's talking and then I'll have some type of kind of whiteboard wheretalking over it and in reading through it asking questions it's very interactive and let me find one really quickly because he's going to go into a lot of the math as well so let me find the math really quickly I can show you how he does that also so this is a good example of how he teaches the math in his course so he usually has some type of visualization and then he has the equation that we're looking at and typically the equation is looks really complex like this one to me I would not understand it at all ifjust taking a look at it but Andrew has a really unique way of just breaking things down helping you understand it and kind of showing you usually on some type of visualization how it actually works in machine learning so if you're not a math person you don't care about the math behind it you know you don't have to skip these sections because they're just so good you'll feel like you understand it because Andrew just teaches it really well but this is still weak one and so in this one you're learning how to train models with gradientgradient descent is along the way you have these quizzes are really great I can't speak highly enough of this course it's just absolutely phenomenal in week two we have multiple linear regression which is something he mentions in the first one but then you actually learn how to implement it and use it in week 2 and we also go into gradient descent and practice so we kind of shows you how it's actually used and not just you know what it is like he did in the second week and then we have a lot of logistic regression it's basically the entirelogistic regression cost function with logistic regression gradient descent for logistic regression and then at the very end you have the problem with overfitting now this one was actually the math was the most interesting in this section to me in this first couple weeks because this one the visuals just phenomenal about how overfitting actually occurs and how to fix it using math I thought it was just extremely interesting soagain if you're not a math person you don't have to take it but I love the math behind this overfitting stuff it was extremely interesting now let's take a look at the advanced learning algorithms chorus and I think this is the one that most people are going to really enjoy especially if you want to get more Hands-On so in this course in the first week we're going to be looking at neural networks and then we'll actually be implementing it using tensorflow and so on this first week we look at neural networks intuition so what is neural networks how is it used to the math behindthat's kind of what you're going to be looking at and then we have neural network models and then we have the tensorflow implementation this is where they actually walk you through how to set up tensorflow how to actually use it to create your first neural network and write down here we have neural network implementation in Python again super happy that they're using python I think that's just a huge upgrade from the previous course is that a lot of people and companies are using python for machine learning and so I think it just shows that they're keeping upthe things that are improving and making things better which is just better for everyone in the long run in week 2 we're still looking at neural networks again this stuff is a lot more of the advanced as the course says it's a lot more the advanced stuff so it's not as introductory like the first course was kind of walking through here's what machine learning is here's how it's used these are like let's dive into the math let's look how to implement let's start using it it goes from beginner to Advanced I think pretty quickly at least advance from meso you know it's kind of like a diving headfirst into the stuff and just really trying to learn it as you go so we have these activation functions we also have multi-class classification and neural networks and how those work together now in week 3 kind of takes a step back and he's like well you know I know I said let's just dive in and learn it and get our hands dirty but we kind of need to take a step back and learn a little bit more so that when you're actually using this you don't just diveplay make a bunch of mistakes so here are some of the things that you should look at so we look at some of his advice for applying machine learning on what models to use and evaluating how if it's good or not we also look at bias and variance and then the machine learning development process and how to actually Implement your machine learning models once you've actually developed them and then the very last week you learn about decision trees and a few different variations and ways to do them so you have decision trees and kind of what they are andthe surface they're pretty simple but they get pretty Advanced that's why it's in this Advanced course but we have the decision tree section right there then we kind of look at how to use them how to implement them and then he walks you through how to actually set it up in the code and then the very bottom we have a few different options things like multiple decision trees sampling with replacement random Forest algorithm and xgboost actually boost is all over I see it everywhere so again these are things thatyou're not going to be using them if you're not going to be implementing these things these are really great things to just know what they are and how they work so that if you are working with somebody who's using these you can at least understand them and work with them instead of just being confused and asking a million questions so the third and final course is the unsupervised learning recommenders and reinforcement learning again this has not been released yet it's not released until July 19th which if you're watching it after July 19th there you go it's alreadybut I plan on releasing this at the first week of July so as of when I'm releasing this this most likely will not be out yet but we can get a sneak peek really quickly into what you're going to be learning in here so you're going to be learning how to use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning including clustering and anomaly detection building a deep reinforcement learning model and Building recommender Systems with collaborative filtering approach and a Content based deep learning method so there you go againwe just don't have it yet so I can't dive into it but it's going to be phenomenal and I'm going to take the whole thing again I am not a machine learning expert but it is really helped me work within my team or my old team when I was working with the data scientists to really understand this stuff so if you're somebody who wants to get into machine learning 10 out of 10 100% you need to take this course and I don't say that for every course it will usually there's a lot of qualifiers it's like if this if that I think that if youis there a pulse and you are even remotely interested in machine learning you should take this course it is by far hands down one of the best courses that you will ever take on machine learning and I've taken several other ones and I've learned a lot more about the implementation and how they actually created and do that but in this one you're going to learn some of that as well we're all going to learn a lot of the math behind it how it actually works and for the original chorus back in 2012 I mean that thing was a staple every machine learninglisten every data scientist had taken it because it was just phenomenal this just Builds on it and makes it better so if you've gotten this far and you are interested in this at all even in the slightest I think you should absolutely take it again I would not be saying that if I did not believe it it's just phenomenal it's one of the best courses on machine learning that you will find out there anywhere so with that being said I hope that this video was helpful I hope that you're as excited about this as I am I think it's just a fantastic reboot anddate of the original chorus it's just really great to see them continuing to improve and make things better over time so thank you again and if you like this video be sure to like And subscribe below I'll see you in the next video
I Reviewed the Python For Everybody Specialization on Coursera by University of Michigan	hey guys it's Greg I don't know how I missed it but apparently I have not reviewed the python for everybody specialization on Coursera offered by the University of Michigan so as you can see the specialization has 184,000 ratings so make way more people have taken that a million point two people have taken it and it has out of that well that's not what I meant to do 4.8 Stars so obviously it is very very good rated by the people and so do I really need to review it well I think it's a good idea to go over all the material and so thewhen is generally like if people think that they had a good experience then they're going to rate it pretty well but that doesn't necessarily mean they have the whole picture and so I want to just review everything there is to go so what you're going to learn install python I sure hope so describe the basics of python I sure hope so use variables again I really hope so and functions and Loops okay so what it says here so far is really really basic stuff and skills you will gain is you know some different file types Jason and XML which are actuallymore important that people think apparently you also learn SQL and SQL light okay so they're going to be interacting using python to interact with SQL and so that's why you will see that in there okay so that's the specialization as a whole it has a few different courses in here if you go over to courses in the specialization course 1 2 3 4 and 5 that's what I have is these tabs over here so the first course is programming for everybody or getting started and of course has very high ratings as well it'sbasics of python you're going to install it and you're going to get used to it that the teaching is very good that's really all I have to say about that python data structures of course the ratings actually it goes up to 4.95% of the Python programming language what are those well it doesn't really say them here for some reason it only says data structure in Tuple but there you go so store data as key value pairs using python dictionaries probably the most important dataaside from the list I'm sure they'll cover list as well and the principles of data structures and how to use them okay so this covers a chapter 6 to 10 in the textbook python for everybody and yes of course as it says Python 3 python 2 is effectively dead we will not be using that using python to access web data okay so this is a very very interesting choice here for a third course it's not probably not what I would have done but that is not at all mean it's a bad decision here we will work with HTML XML and Jasonformats in Python okay so regular Expressions use apis and understand protocol web web web browsers and XML okay so there's a lot of different things here that isn't really about what python is python is a programming language to you know do things but these are some of the things that you often end up working with in any sort of programming language you often you don't make or read XML files I saw Jason earlier you use that a lot okay so it's an interesting choiceokay using databases with python another interesting choice because you probably wouldn't expect a again a fourth course to be in just basically SQL but it's a really really underestimated how often these things interact so a lot of people think like okay SQL is SQL which it is it's a programming language sort of kind of and python is a programming language we have to learn these two differentdelete operations to manage databases you need to understand SQL and don't worry they'll teach you those pieces that you need for this don't worry about that and they use Python to interact with that which is a lot more common than you might think like you may it may be actually as simple as just literally passing an SQL string into a python function or itbe a sort of python abstraction itself to do the SQL data retrieval stuff so again I really really like this decision and people people love it as well as you can see the final thing is the Capstone retrieving processing and visualizing data with python so they say date of is I don't really know who says that I've seen it before it's kind of silly but basically chapters 15 to 16 and the service is the backbone for the Capstone project so understand the basics ofa search engine it's you know it's just a choice there's a lot of different things they could do for a Capstone project that's just what they thought would be interesting and some email data visualization as well okay so why did I go over all these different things well basically it's not going to make you a master in Python quite genuinely I can see from what's in there and you know I'm relatively familiar with with the actual material itself you probably will not be a master of python after this if I was an employerI wouldn't really be fascinated that you got this to be honest because I know if I want to bother to look at what the course has here I'd say okay you can use Python and you can do a bunch of different things with it and so the material as it's for itself as a free thing to go over and learn so you can go of course enroll for free and you know you can always audit the courses in Corsair the material is free and so I would definitely recommend going through that if you're not familiar super familiar with python already if youare already relatively familiar with python I probably wouldn't do this if you've taken this or you think about taking this drop a comment down below and I'll see you later
7 Keys for Prompt Engineering  Coursera Review	I just completed the scores on prompt engineering and hear the top seven tips I learned number one Persona pattern if you want high quality answers tell Chad GPT to act as an expert for example as a chemist or an accountant without the Persona you tend to get broad vague answers number two question refinement pattern often the way we formulate the question is not perfect ask your GPT to reformulate the question and then use it number three for each new topic use a new chat everything that is said in oneinfluences the output so start a new session for a new topic number four Chain of Thought prompting for more complex tasks ask check GPT to explain its reasoning it often helps with the output particularly if you're asking to do math number 5 few short prompting if you want a specific task done give Chad GPT a few examples first number six outline expansion pattern for a long tasks ask your GPD for an outline then ask it to fill out the outstep-by-step number 7 flipped interaction pattern sometimes it is easier when Chad GPD is asking the questions tell Chad GPT you want to achieve X then tell it to ask you questions to get the information it needs if you're getting value out of this video please consider subscribing for more content like this the course is divided into 6 weeks but it can be completed much faster I did it at a pretty easy Pace in 4 days but if you completely clear your schedule you can probably complete in 48 hours there is a 7-Day free trial and afterthat it is $50 a month I highly recommend to just pick a week where you have a lot of time and bring it out and then 7 days and do it for free after the completion you get a standard Coursera certificate in each week there are several videos and also text summaries of the key points they also assignments that you complete using Chad GPT it says that I got 100% on each of the assignments but I don't think the assignments are actually created you just need to submit something so I think that's a little bit of a weakness of the course because it doesn't really test your knowledge what are you grasp it or not this is very different from thewhat are courses that took with Coursera like the Deep learning specialization those assignments were quite challenging and you definitely have to complete them correctly in order to get the credit Pros you get a nice overview of different prompt strategies it is a good starter course it is definitely more useful if you are a beginner to check GPT and the presenter is very easy to understand cons the interest pretty boring the later parts of the course have more useful content many examples are cool demos but I don't see the practical application for example explain large languagewhat's to Christopher Columbus it gives you creative output but I don't know how it is useful other than for a high school essay overall summary I think it's definitely worth it if you are new to large language models like Chad gbt and you can complete the course and under 7 days for free to people in the AI field the certificate is probably worthless but the people outside of the field it might give you a slight Edge the quality of the content is not massively better than what you can find on YouTube but since it is taught by University professor and you can get a certificate it is better than learning from YouTube thankswatching I'll see you next video
