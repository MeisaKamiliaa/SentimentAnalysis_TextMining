There are several courses you can choose from, some requires payment some are not. I took a course which was made by a private university in the states and the instructor is really professional on her videos, even tho you don't have the full set of ideas behind that course it still explains to you like you are kindergarten on a class. They also provide transcripts for you to read if you have time. I even learned Japanese with it. Well my recommendation from choosing a course is something you really love and like. I happened to choose a course on my college days and ended up not liking it. So better look for the one that will totally make you grind for more.\n",

      "Some certifications give you credit hours, now there are degrees and masters on the website. I’m in IT support, looking into cyber security analyst, and AZU’s computer science masters with a specialization in cybersecurity\n",
      "\n",
      "PS. I’m coming from a non tech background. I only know CSS, HTML and SPSS. I majored in Sociology at UVA. It’s very doable guys! Don’t give up, I love Coursera!\n",
      "Thanks for your comment, Jhayda! Definitely a good option to explore! I'd also suggest, if you're looking into CS, Georgia Tech has one of the best programs (also available online) and it's around $10K. Pretty rigorous though from what I understand!\n",
      " @RichardWalls  THANK YOU SO MUCH! I was definitely looking into it and received a few emails about it. I’ll definitely be checking it out.\n",
      "Yes I love it too, I highly recommended to my friends using Coursera and pay for it\n",
      "I'm currently a new pre-nursing student and plan on taking Coursera's anatomy and physiology course prior to actually enrolling in that course with my school so that I can frontload the knowledge I need so that when I actually take the course I can be as successful as possible. I'm super excited I came across Coursera.\n",
      "I've been studying from MOOCs for years and always have come across Coursera (paying money for certain courses has turned me away), but now I am reconsidering and will be working on the equivalent of a doctorate and actually having something to show for it. I've wasted money over the years on superfluous things but have come to realize investing in education (outside of buying textbooks) is is well worth it.\n",
      "Certainly for the price, it's great to build a portfolio of certificates, along with projects or other examples of work.\n",
      "Hi Richard. I was looking for the perfect review on Coursera and I am in the right place. Thank you for this video. I am starting classes on Coursera.\n",

      "hi my friend! aftr 9 month have coursera has been helpfull for your interests?\n",
      "Did it do anything for you?\n",
      "Best review is trying by yourself .it is free\n",
      "Coursera is brilliant. All courses I have completed have supported me in my career.️\n",
      "Awesome to hear, Cristiane! What courses/specializations did you take and how did it help you?\n",
      "can you please explain?\n",
      "Taking Coursera courses has been the best thing that happened to me in the last 2 years.\n",
      "Nice to hear! Has it led to any new career opportunities or advancement? Or did it help in other ways?\n",
      "can you please elaborate? did it help you get a job?\n",
      " @torreto5391  these dudes don’t wanna explain haha\n",
      " @torreto5391  I'm starting to believe they're dishonest :/\n",
      "I appreciate your review. I completed my first Coursera course just recently. Mine was available through the university where I work so it was free. I agree the peer-grading feedback was hit or miss. I did learn a lot from reading what other people turned in for assignments. And I personally tried to provide decent feedback. Some of the feedback was really thoughtful. Some was not even written in complete sentences! LOL! But I enjoyed the course a lot and will probably continue in the certification it is part of.\n",
      "Awesome to hear - thanks for sharing! It does help quite a bit to see what other people have done in the peer review process. And appreciate you being one of the users that does provide good peer feedback. \n",
      "I lost an opportunity due to lack of experience in an area . I am now working on getting a certification to make myself more marketable! Thanks for your insight!\n",
      "Coursera will give you skills but your BODY OF WORK is what will get you hired. You need a portfolio of work nowadays to stand out. Merely knowing and having the certificate is not enough. Start a Youtube Channel and/or website to showcase. your skills. This is a MUST.\n",
      "Certificate is a start, but completely agree. Need to get that experience and have demonstrable skills!\n",
      "I've just finished the AWS IOT course.. it was not for beginner and fortunately i am familliar with AWS from last year. Some exercise was written in 2019 and as 2021 AWS has upgrading some services,  so after exercise 3 it is not meet the required upgraded version. But after all,  it is boosting my confidence for this pandemic era as coursera approved my financial aid.\n",
      "That's awesome to hear! Thanks for the comment. What are you looking to achieve as far as next role in your career?\n",
      " @RichardWalls   not much to expect, but i switch to educational jobs as it is more demand during this pandemic\n",
      "I commend you on clarifying a little of the difference between the specialization and the courses.\n",
      "Thank you for making this video. I'm stuck between taking a payroll course(s) with Coursera or taking a course with CUNY. I live in NYC and the price point is a huge difference. I'm currently paying for my son's college tuition and was wondering if Coursera would be worth the money as I would like to further my knowledge in finance but don't want to waste money. I truly appreciate your honesty and thoroughness.\n",
      "I want to get a master degree in business administration and VFX and a specialization in software development and the fact that I don't have to go to a physical university and study both at the same time is amazing.\n",
      "Love this video  - I saw on the sight that it would be $39 a month and it’s about 10 hours per week in less than 6 months, just wanted to make sure if that was accurate and also if it’s a certain time frame when we complete the classes are we suppose to schedule the test for the certification itself or everything is all inclusive?\n",
      "Hi! Thanks for the comment. I'd say alot of the courses/specializations can be done quite a bit faster than what's advertised. Of course, totally depends on your familiarity with the subject, and whether you skip some content and try to complete assignments faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything is included from what you mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope this helps!\n",
      " @RichardWalls  Okay Great ! Thank you so much for the response back  I really appreciate it !\n",
      "I've taken Cybersecurity in college and Coursera and Coursera was excellent! They explained everything in a way I could better understand. The free course is nothing but listening so making sure you takes notes is highly important to make sure you know you are learning & understanding the content. Highly recommend \n",
      "Coursera is great, but most of the courses I have done there were built in such way that if you do not achieve 100% score, you probably can not read. Exception being e.g. Pavel Pevzner's Bioinformatics specialisation or the original 2012 version of the Probabilistic Graphical Models course (has been diluted and split into several courses now, so not sure about that one any more).\n",
      "\n",
      "In this respect, I found MITx courses on edX  better (and I like edX UX significantly more as well - yes, this is subjective). In order to pass those, you have to understand the subject matter, apply it in a creative way to a problem you have never seen before - so you have to actually think as opposed to Coursera's norm of simple recall quizzes. The only problem of those MITx courses is that they run on extremely crazy schedules, so having full-time job and/or family makes it almost impossible to do them simply because of lack of time.\n",
      "The course difficulty really does vary by course. So far, they've been easy to moderately difficult, nothing too crazy. I'd look into some of the professional certificates, as the level of rigor may be higher there. \n",
      "\n",
      "edX is another great platform though - they usually have little to no overlap in university partnerships and courses (last I checked), so they're really good complements to one another.\n",
      "I’m debating on taking courses has anyone taken any and have been able to advance in their careers?  Has your employers or others recognized the education from Coursera\n",

      "So I study using Coursera. I have taken a few courses on variety of fields I am interested in. I did an introductory marketing course ( from Wharton) and currently doing an accounting course ( also from Wharton). I wanna learn more about different branches of business as I am still trying to figure out what I like the most and what I should choose to pursue my degree. Now I wanna learn about business administration .Can you recommend me some great courses about business management or business administration for newbies on Coursera?\n",
      "Thank you \n",
      "@RichardWalls My company gives us access to the Coursera+ classes, some of which are taken straight from the UIUC iMBA courses. From what I could see, if you take these courses ahead of enrolling in the iMBA, you can use them towards your degree. Having been a part of both Coursera and iMBA at UIUC, do you know if this is an additional way to save some $$ on the 12 or so credits I currently have access to? Or is it something that you inevitably have to pay for when transferring those credits for consideration/grades? Thanks man, great channel!

Well, really an average of one chapter. Plus of midterm if that happens depending on the professor and sometimes on rarer cases a final exam. What is Coursera like?\n",

      "If you have no degree or experience in cyber security, I would not set your expectations to jump into a mid-high level role. You'd be better suited to exploring entry level roles after you earn some certs. A degree would be even better, and there are some options through UC Berkeley and Syracuse University.\n",
      "I’m on the same thing\n",
      "Wondering too. My husband believes some videos encouraging to obtain a cyber security certificate claiming you'll be making six figures to start...I say highly unlikely but would like opinions\n",

      "Thanks!\n",
      "my question abou the certificates is are they considered as real ones in the job market or just a self development thing you can use to just boost your chance a bit?\n",
      "Hi Torreto - great question! More the latter - better for self development and signals to prospective employers that you prioritize self improvement. Some of these certificate, depending on the field (programming/coding, UX, art, etc), will result in you having built some portfolio of work that you can showcase, which can be very valuable.\n",
      " @RichardWalls  thank you! I appreciate the honesty man. You get a subscribe for that🫡\n",

      "Hi Omayma - if you're talking about managing people, it's unlikely to find a job doing so with only Coursera content. But you'd be able to land other roles that give you the opportunity to move up and eventually into management.\n",
      "Great content. What do you think about Vonza platform?\n",
      "Hi Olivia - thank you! Vonza looks to be a bit different. More of a hosting platform for creators/educators to share and monetize their online courses. Looks to be a closer comparison to Udemy, which also is a hosting platform for individual creators.\n",

      "Can one put these on a resume and get a job for example Comptia + and Security + certs and get a job are they accepted by most employers or are these \"decorative wallpaper\" like a continuation learning which is nice and all lets employers know you seek improvement.\n",
      "Hi! Yes, certainly worth including on your resume where appropriate (based on jobs you're applying for) and would be a great complement to some of the industry-recognized CompTIA certs. I've included coursework on my resume when it related to the role I applied for.\n",

      "Hi - I'd suggest finishing out your bachelors degree, but having additional certs that can augment what you're already doing can only help.

      " @RichardWalls  Thanks, but will the certificate show I completed the course from Penn University?\n",
      " @richardcontell1314  yup, but it does not counts as a Credit, unless the course says so. I did a course from yale about psych and it has the yale logo and the coursera as well. It says you completed a xourse from that uni from coursera, your name and the teachers signature\n",

It was a lot of \"water\" in what seemed to be like an intro to an actual course, but then there was a \"test\", which one had to pass to get further. I was extremely frustrated to put it mildly, seems like the aim of such \"test\" is not to test ones knowledge, but with how much BS one is willing to put up with.\n",
      "User interface isn't brilliant either - here on YouTube you can use fast backward and forward, if you missed something, on Coursera it just isn't there. I don't remember anymore, what other issues with UI there was, but I recall myself thinking how ironic it is to have those for a site, which claims to teach web design and programming skills.\n",

      "Hi! Unfortunately, no. 1. Free courses mean that all the content & assignments are available, whereas \"non-free\" courses give you the option to \"audit\";  this usually allows you to access alot of the content in a course, but not all of it until you pay a fee to pursue a certificate. 2. Not all of the free courses even offer a paid certificate; you'll need to check the FAQ section at the bottom of each course.\n",
      " @RichardWalls  thanks a lot!♡♡\n",
      "Do you get a job with Coursera certificate or not?\n",
      "Thank you for Video!\n",
      "I need an advice, please...\n",
      "I study online in university but I while I am studying I need more experience and skills which I do not get from university. I am thinking to try to  get a course from coursera, but I am not sure if I can work with certificate from coursera? Because I didn't graduate yet, but I want to start working, can I work with that certificate? Is it possible or not ?\n",
      " If you know any good courses for event management and Marketing, I would appreciate it !! thank you \n",
      "Hi Anna - a Coursera certificate can improve your marketability as a candidate for a job (depending on the cert & the job). Still need to network quite a bit to develop those connections.\n",
      "Hi Anna which online University are you going to? I am looking for one. But all expensive for me to afford for now. How is your online school? affordable?\n",
      "Hi Anna which online University are you going to? I am looking for one. But all expensive for me to afford for now. How is your online school? affordable?\n",
      "I'm interested but I don't see how people whom have been high school drop outs can now attend Berkley. My question is say I use coursera and I get my B.A in computer science and I apply to IBM London, and the recruiter sees I've got a b.a from Harvard University. He decides to check with the dean of Harvard to make sure I've graduated from there. Is that dean or registrar office going to say \"hey, yeah he graduated from here I can see him in our program\". Or will they not have any information of me ever using there services.\n",
      "Hi - not quite how that works. You don't attend any of these universities, you just take courses that were created by the universities that are hosted on this platform. As for the degrees that Coursera offers, that's a different pathway; you'd have to apply to the university and get accepted.\n",
      "1. does it has weight in the course, 2-- will they help us get job, 3 how will be course conduct via zoom link, 4-- what type of job will i get, 5 after completing do we get job anywhere --   Salary how much i get ?\n",
      "thank u\n",
      "Hi Vijay - not sure of your questions, but will try to answer. 1) Yes. 2) Yes, but will depend on your ability to network and find opportunities. Having certificates will boost your resume. 3) It's all prerecorded video - no Zoom. 4) Depends on courses/certs you get. 5) You have to find opportunities on your own, and salary will depend on job.\n",
      " @RichardWalls  :)\n",
      "No, is just a certificate. You add that into your resume and hunt for jobs lol duhh!! Good luck, because it's competitive as well . \n",

      "Thanks for this\n",
      "No problem, Michael!\n",
      "Cuestión si I can take more then one course for same price ?\n",
      "Hi Mercedes - you might want to explore the Coursera PLUS subscription that they offer. It allows you to take as many courses as you want for just one monthly fee. Check out my other video on my channel on that service for more info!\n",
      "How much are the certs?\n",
      "i can't believe the amount of courses you guys are saying you take. is this average? is this necessary to remain competitive for your fields? i often try to learn things on my own, but i haven't been able to use one of these services. i would like to bring myself to the level that i have real certifications or other things i can use to get a job. but sometimes i wonder if it's worth it or that what really  counts is real experience. is it possible to move into a new career with one of these certificates? is this similar to actual college courses? the price is not extremely cheap and i wouldn't expect it to be if this is legit, but i don't even have a computer set up at the moment and i question whether or not it will be worth it in the long run.\n",
      "It is not just about certifications but also knowledge delivered in a structured and bit sized manner which sticks with you if you do the courses correctly and with patience. Certifications are the proof that yes you have the drive to upskill yourself in the field of your interest. It shows your own drive to improve yourself to be a better version of you.\n",
      "Hi Simon - really depends. Most of the courses I took were part of a degree program. The remainder are supplementary courses that help bridge gaps in roles that I might've been interested in, but didn't have experience or education. Would agree 100% with Vivek's assessment as well.\n",
      "Which IoT courses did you take?\n",
      "This one from UC Irvine: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/iot\n",
      " @RichardWalls  Thank you so much, for getting back to me Richard Walls. This is definitely a great starting point for me. I will take this course, and I see that I can enroll today. I appreciate the career development and finance mentoring you offer, it's awesome! I was particularly interested in your journey to becoming a product manager especially in the IoT space (I am working for a tech company that develops software for IoT spaces) . I aspire to be a product manager soon, and I'm working towards it. Thanks for the guidance. I have my eye on a couple of online MBAs to consider, thanks to your video on that... Brilliant!! I am grateful.\n",

      "What do you think about MasterTrack certificate? i was thinking to do, but the price is high and i didnt find feedback\n",
      "Hi - I think those are great options. Price point is a bit higher, but that's partly due to the fact that the courses you take can count towards transferrable credit to the corresponding full-degree program. ASU's Cybersecurity MasterTrack cert, for example, will get you 9 of the 30 required credits to actually pursue and complete the full degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "So MasterTracks are, in a sense, a paid trial of a full degree where you can still earn a Certificate by completing the MasterTrack, but then you have the option of pursuing the full degree and be able to transfer credits and get a head start.\n",

      "What I don't like of LinkedIn Learning is that their Learning Paths sometimes feel disjointed, especially when it comes to web development or any other programming language, which they also have but a handful of them. They start with the fundamentals, but the next course, although it progresses on what you learned, it is not related, nor it develops upon the previous course. \n",
      "In contrast, Udemy has bootcamps and they start from the fundamentals and build up from there, following a path that is engaging. \n",
      "It is still very good quality material (LL), and I would absolutely recommend it if it were cheaper, but sadly they want you to pay for all the LinkedIn premium \"advantages\" you may never need just to unlock the learning experience.\n",

Sometimes, their assignments forces you to think out of the box. In other words, they force you to interiorize the knowledge by hart. However, Coursera is more of a guided path towards a very simplified and  narrow goal. To provide an example, the Harvard professional certificate at edX for Data Science takes more than a year to complete. The similar ones (IBM) at coursera take less than a year. This just reflects the point that edX offers a more broad preparation while Coursera reduces the content to increase learning speed.

I like to compare the Google Cybersecurity certificate to being at a restaurant where they give you bread or chips and salsa before you even get an appetizer, but the restaurant doesn't actually offer the appetizer, main meal, or dessert....this gives you something to snack on, but there's a lot of ground to make up to actually pass something like the Security+.\n",

I'm a former software developer, roughly from 1991 - 2012 ... as you can tell, I'm on the older side of people thinking of this industry, and I am very interested in the cyber security career. I was studying about a year ago for the Security+ certification, and convinced myself that having that on my resume would not be enough to get my foot in the door, and did not take the exam. Now, I'm ready to spend some money and try to get that door opened, even though I have a '6' in the first digit of my age. \n",

      " @Alpha1CA  it can be found on my website: https://jongood.com/getstarted/\n",
      "My vote is clearly  for Google Cybersecurity Certificate ... and nobody paid me for that :)\n",
      "Explanation: in my opinion Google Cybersecurity Certificate is actually good as an entry-level training.  Outside of US, Comptia Security+ isn't that popular and highly demanded. In my country  Google certificate training costs 14$ (still cheap in US -  49$/month less expensive what Sec+ costs, 400$) and you get comparable knowledge as Security+  . In fact,  Google Cybersec has hands-on which Security+ doesn't.  This is a huge plus for Google certificate. We can discuss how in-depth or not those hands-on are, but  hey, this is entry level cert.\n",
      "You're welcome to your opinion; however, you will never convince me of any significant value in certifications that employers don't list in job postings, among many other reasons, some of which are stated in this video review. Your statement about the Security+ not having hands-on is actually false. Plenty of tools and technologies are covered by the exam objectives. That means if you do not get hands-on experience, that is either a function of ignoring the exam objectives, a failure on your training provider, or both. Additionally, the hands-on labs inside the Coursera training are not graded for accuracy or completeness and can be easily bypassed, as stated in this review. The Google Cybersecurity Certificate and Security+ are nowhere near the same caliber of coverage.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber   \"you will never convince me of any significant value in certifications that employers don't list in job postings\" -   well, yes, it's new one.  Only time will show.\n",
      "\"That means if you do not get hands-on experience,\" -  a big majority of Sec+ certified folks have just done video course +  probably have read book + practice exams. That applied to 95+% as reddit comtpia's channel and discord channel have demostrated. Sad but true. You're talking about ideal approach of Sec+ certification which included labs which will cost  extra 100-200$ and only small percentage of people want to pay for it. While Security+ is only multiple choice + PBQs it's essentially  still purely theoretic exam.\n",
      "The Google Cybersecurity training offered in partnership with Coursera is one of the best and affordable beginner level certification. I think your review primarily based on your expertise, ignoring this training was ment for absolute beginners. I also noticed your replies of comments here are directing viewers to your online course platform, this in my opinion also contributed to your bias review. Honestly I'm enjoying the content. Again I will like you to show proof of completing the whole course in 4 days because I'm battling this for some months now. Thank you.\n",
      "You're welcome to your opinion, but even ignoring my objective review, other comments demonstrate that many viewers don't share the same opinion as you and instead support my review. It sounds like you are new to my content, so I recommend watching more of the value that I bring. Still, I help people every day go from zero to Cyber Pro, so I suppose I have a bias toward platforms and options that work as advertised...but your specific comment is wildly inaccurate as it infers something else. Based on your final comment, I'm unsure what led you to believe I was new to the industry. I've posted every completion certificate associated with the Google Cybersecurity Certificate on my LinkedIn (  ) if you want to crosscheck my claims.\n",
      "i have done this in 3.5 days. I can give you proof :) I enrolled last Fri, Sep 27, 6:58 AM and finished Mon, Sep 30, 11:51 AM. Those dates I copy pasted from the email I got when I enrolled and when I receive the congratulatory email on my last course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately I have to pay for certificate which I thought I will not have to :)\n",
      "I am actually currently taking the Google Cyber security course I'm on the third one which I guess would be course 3... Anyway I greatly appreciate your honest opinion because now I think I should probably lean more towards going ahead and studying for the security plus instead. I can put my valuable money and efforts into that which will get me further than this one would. Again I greatly appreciate your brutal honest opinion and it's helped me see which way I need to go. Thank you sir.\n",
      "I'm glad that you enjoyed the review! I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and checking out the included roadmap of skills and certifications. This is the path that anybody trying to get into Cybersecurity should follow.\n",
      "It’s the perfect entry level cert as it is one of the only entry level certs that actually involves significant hands on experience\n",
      "As I've said in the comments for this video, there are tools and technologies in the Security+ exam objectives, so if you aren't getting that exposure, it's either a failure on the training provider you're using and / or ignoring the exam objectives. Also, from a training program perspective, the Google Cybersecurity Certificate doesn't actually grade or test your performance for the labs, so it's debatable how much value you receive.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  not sure I agree . I deliver bootcamps for Cyber learners with no prior experience in the UK and I can’t think of a better qual for this level of learner. It boils down to where the learners are at .\n",
      "I agree, one can get this Cert spending very few $ then build from there.\n",
      "Your review is 100% true! When I reviewed the course outline, I was quite surprised that they had SQL and Python as part of their curriculum. While those are nice to have, it's overwhelming for any beginner. Thanks for the real, and honest review. \n",
      "Glad it was helpful!\n",
      "I have been looking for jobs and there are soooooo many jobs in IT that require SQL in my area, like a lot!\n",
      " @Ameion  Interesting! I hadn't seen SQL as a requirement yet. Python maybe, but mostly for more advanced positions to automate.\n",
      " @Ameion  I'm not sure what you consider \"a lot,\" but it's a relatively small percentage of the overall jobs that ask for it and an even smaller percentage that actually requires it in the job itself. You should be focusing on the things that large percentages of jobs are asking for...not the number of jobs as that doesn't indicate what the market actually wants. Also, I never said that SQL knowledge is bad...it's all about learning the priority knowledge and then filling in the gaps as you go.\n",
      "⁠ @JonGoodCyber What are these things that large percentage of jobs are asking for?\n",
      " @Chase10995  You can find my recommendations in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ). Alternatively, you can also search on job boards yourself, although that's less efficient.\n",
      "Yes, you should have some serious understanding of how networks work before taking this class, I got my Network+ and took a CCNA class before taking this cert course. I thought this course was amazing, it taught me a lot. Don't knock it. It is so much better than most of the cybersecurity courses out there.\n",
      "Interested in google courses on Coursera in general and cyber secruity was one that seemed to be pushed quite a lot, so seeing your truthful evaluation on it is extremely helpful. Thanks Jon you did good :)\n",
      "Thank you for sharing and I'm glad that you found the content helpful!\n",
      "I’m in course seven and everything you said in on par with my experience thus far. I would have enjoyed more in depth analysis of packets but I’ll have to get that from Chris Greer vids. At this point I’m just gonna finish it. It was something to do during summer so my interests wouldn’t wane. Now that classes have resumed it’s an afterthought compared to my college courses.  Thanks for your valuable insight.\n",
      "Thanks for sharing and I'm glad that you enjoyed the video! Definitely if you're already to course seven, just finish it out and keep moving.\n",
      "Currently half way through the course on the Linux portion. I have been enjoying the amount of knowlegdge i'm soaking in based on this whole course. This for me was the best way to introduce myself in the field as i'm currentlly working in help desk for about 1.5 yeears and looking for the next step. I'm definetly looking forward to using the sec + voucher especially since my employer agreed to pay for the exam with the voucher once I complete this certificate. I am already prepard to study for the 601 after I finish this course. Any advice on what I should be doing now as im going through the course or even after completetion besides taking the sec+ ?\n",
      "If you're already taking the certificate training, use it for what it is...a basic introduction...and I wouldn't really stop and get caught up on anything. The reality is that it only covers a very small subset of the knowledge that you need for the Security+, and it doesn't do all that great of a job so it's not worth trying to overachieve through it. I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and looking at the roadmap because if you have gaps in your knowledge right now, the course isn't going to fix that. This will also give you an idea of the skills and certifications that you need for all areas of Cybersecurity. Then I would check out Cyber Training Pro (  ) where there's a bunch of training and career services to really accelerate your career progression.\n",

      " @TerryJulianLive hey a job is job nothing ridiculous about that. It all depends on if you have plans/goal. What you expect & works for you might not work for others.\n",
      "I would recommend doing some research, be sure to chk their reviews.   Also Compare courses & prices before signing up. There’s some that have really good deals while others charge $800 more than the avg rate. Rn almost all prep courses have the same syllabus.\n",
      "i've seen ads for these a bunch of times and I've been in a situation where I can do a career change if I wanted to, and I have a slight curiosity in doing cybersecurity. I searched up the course and then decided to check out reviews and looked at yours first because of the ONLY UNSPONSORED in the title. I was totally about to put down some money to do the course up until now. Thanks!\n",
      "Thank you for sharing and glad that I could help! Remember, it's not necessarily that paid training is a bad thing but this program isn't one that is worth it for most people. I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and following the included roadmap.\n",
      " @GensUnaSumus09  The advice that I give is backed by both facts and statistics. If you don't believe it, you are more than welcome to go on a job board and search for yourself to find the exact same conclusions. The reality is that I help people break into the industry and fast-track their careers every single day. Also, to imply that my FREE eBook is some scam is ridiculous and very troll-like. I hope you have a better day.\n",
      "Lol my first video wasn't sponsored because we couldn't come to terms so I just released it anyways \n",
      "You definitely need to heavily augment the cert to get a job, but I think it provides great theory in general.\n",
      "Great video!\n",
      "Josh when are you going to start posting again would love to hear updates on both your courses and the outlook and what jobs to look out for with cuts occurring in certain areas and for people transitioning from a non tech job.\n",
      "It would be a waste of time, when can use your time to work on certs that maximizes your opportunity for job and skills.\n",
      "I became suspicious when I started getting a ton of correspondence for me to sponsor content about the certificate, and I just couldn't do it after simply a surface-level analysis before completing the program. The truth is that the Google Cybersecurity Certificate is like a very slow crawl phase for a career and, as stated, wouldn't be enough on its own. I'd love to see the churn number for students because it drops off significantly at around course 3 or 4, and by the end, there is a very small percentage of students still around.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  I know 2 people who stop because they realized they weren't that interested in cybersecurity as they thought.  Lets not forget a lot of people have misconception of cybersecurity because they realize how much Hollywood has embellish on the field.\n",
      " @rcvargas26  I've been in the industry long enough to see plenty of people come and go, but honestly, I'm not all that worried about that. Like anything, that \"new car smell\" disappears, and reality sets in. Every profession and career field has people who get the initial spark of interest, realize it's not what they thought, and move on...that's life.\n",
      "Josh still waiting on your next video!!!\n",
      "Hopefully it’s on the Microsoft cybersecurity professional certificate\n",
      "So a beginners course is basic, omg I never excepted that\n",
      "Good one...\n",
      "ikr? lmao.\n",
      "Lmaooo\n",
      "I started taking the course.  It seemed like a good primer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm doing it on weekends and using my weeknights to learn stuff on try hack me.  I really like learning in parallel like this.  I also enjoy the bite size pieces from thm.\n",

      "I'm hoping that this can be the beginning to a career, but I'm only done with course 4, so halfway through, and I'm going through the junior soc rooms at thm.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's pretty fun though.\n",
      "Thank you for sharing! Understand that I'm not saying by taking this program that you're going to be a worse professional, but instead it's a matter of the most effective and efficient path based on what you need to be successful, and what will actually make an impact on your career. I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and checking out the included roadmap. The roadmap provides what I would consider the minimum to be expected of you and of course, you can and should add skills and knowledge beyond that.\n",
      "Hi I’ve got some issues on my thm excercies I don’t know if you can put me through pls..\n",
      "Google definitely oversells these courses. I took the Data Analytics course and it barely scratched the surface and in no way, shape, or form did it get me career ready. I decided to take the Google Cyber one since it gets you prepped for the Security+ cert. What are your thoughts on the Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate offered by Coursera?\n",
      "I to the MS security course and the google one, the MS one covers a lot of the same ground but also feels super marketing heavy this time with a focus on Azure/AD and other MS products, but it does sort of go through Azure/AD 101 which is very important and something that the google course skips over completely.\n",
      "From a job market standpoint, you still have a similar issue where employers aren't asking for the certification. Looking at the content itself, it appears to be built to give you some immediate skills but you're not going to have broad knowledge of security as it's highly focused on building those specific skills.\n",
      "I've started the Cybersecurity course, had to take a break due to personal reasons, but I am hoping to finish it soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what I have seen in it, it's fairly good. Although I have no cybersec background. Maybe this video isn't sponsored by Google but seems like it's affiliated with a course that is a direct competitor. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think lots of people think this is an ALL IN ONE cert, although it says in the description that it was built alongside CompTIA as an intro for people with no background and want to take the security+ cert. which is the main reason I am taking this one just to get BASIC knowledge so that I can take that, along with other studying, and attempt security+. (also apparently you get a discount for it lol) \n",
      "\n",
      "I will hopefully be back shortly with an update once I finish the course :D\n",
      "Good luck, and hopefully, whatever caused the break is behind you! When you're a new or aspiring professional, one of the challenges is that all knowledge seems good, but you don't have the context from experience to see what you actually end up using. That said, you should use what employers list in job postings to help drive your learning and development. Ultimately, the Google Cybersecurity Certificate isn't something employers are asking for; it just takes a simple job search to validate what I'm saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Google unnecessarily focuses on very introductory things as if people can't handle certain concepts. In contrast, Cyber Training Pro focuses on giving you the most effective and efficient path possible, going from zero knowledge/skills to a fully proficient professional. I wouldn't call them competitors because Google is really targeted at people who are very unsure if they want to get into the career field, but past that point, you would want to turn to Cyber Training Pro to get the actual training and advice required.\n",
      "Totally understand and as you progress in your journey, more options become available based on budget and for other reasons. The CIA triad is a fundamental concept for Cybersecurity, so it is definitely covered. Think of the Google course as scratching the surface where they briefly talk about some topics to give you a \"taste,\" however the Cyber Training Pro course covers information at a deeper level instead of just briefly mentioning topics. As far as prep for the Security+, you will definitely have to do more studying after the Google program whereas the Cyber Training Pro course is built specifically to prepare you based on the exam objectives.\n",
      "Thanks for your honest review! I'm taking the IT support cert and plan on taking the Cybersecurity one as well. Just to help prepare for the Sec+.\n",
      "Thanks for sharing! I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and checking out the included roadmap to see what I recommend.\n",
      "Moving from software engineering to cybersecurity so I looked into this cert and found your video. Thank you for going out of the way to look into this cert and complete it yourself! +1 sub from me. def will check your other videos. Mad respect for the unbiased opinion\n",
      "Glad it was helpful and welcome to the community!\n",
      "This was the most honest review I've come across thank you\n",
      "Glad you liked it!\n",
      "WATCH THE ENTIRE REVIEW. Finally a good and direct review. Windows is not getting phased out anytime during my lifetime. There needs to be major focus on Windows.\n",
      "I'm glad that you enjoyed the review!\n",
      "What annoys me is that some people who have zero knowledge in IT  and cybersecurity, want to land a job within 3 to 6 months, most even don't bother working in the technical skills related to the cybersecurity path they want to pursue.\n",
      "I don't blame the individuals for that, and is instead a result of so many \"influencers\" and marketing efforts setting unrealistic/false expectations. In fact, I get a ton of viewers and community members that find my content after listening to so much of the bad advice out there wishing they would have found me sooner.\n",
      "Hey Joh.  How are you?  What apps, bootcamps, websites and/or tools would you recommend for a beginner?\n",
      "I always recommend visiting my Getting Started page ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ), which provides several resources including my free eBook that discusses that question and more!\n",
      "The value of this cert or any form of knowledge depends on your goal.  If your goal is to get a job in security, the probability of doing that solely by completing a cert that takes a relatively short amount to complete is minimal.  However, if you're looking for a base level of knowledge to build upon or if you're not certain security is right for you, the Google cert is fantastic.  It's just not magic.\n",
      "Certainly goals vary by the individual and should always be a major driver in the decisions that anybody makes. That said, most people aren't looking for such an \"appetizer\" type program like this and this program isn't the most effective and efficient path to reach the majority of peoples goals. Don't mistake this information for me saying that somehow this information will hold you back in the long term, but I specialize in fast tracking careers with the most effective and efficient path possible, because that's what people want...so that's what my advice is geared towards.\n",
      "Thank you for the honest review..I have a question?\n",
      "Q: what course or study do u recommend that’s gonna make u “from no knowledge of IT to a cybersecurity professional”?\n",
      "I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ), where I've documented that information and more, to set you up for success!\n",
      "Got my attention now.  So many cybersecurity experts on here, it's good to identify someone who is straight forward and doesn't blow smoke.  Appreciate your honest review!!!\n",
      "There's a lot of people talking about cybersecurity but I wouldn't classify many of them as \"experts.\" I'm glad that you enjoyed the video!\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  For those on the outside, it's a little harder to determine.\n",
      "The algorithm certainly doesn't help that but now that you've found me, you have a great resource to utilize!\n",
      "if a person already did that course, what would you recommend they do afterwards, also lets say a person already found a job in that field, would you still recommend other type of education to follow up on?\n",
      "I appreciate your feed back on this material and from scanning over some of the content agree with you.  Thank You.\n",
      "Glad it was helpful!\n",
      "So from where would you suggest to start if Google Cybersecurity Certificate is bad ? I'm 35y and i want to change my career to Cybersecurity ( i have 0 knowledge about it ). What's the steps i should to take to end up with a job in Cybersecurity ? Thank you\n",
      "You'll want to check out my free eBook (linked in the description), which includes a roadmap of skills and certifications to pursue.\n",
      "I already passed my sec+ over a year and a half ago. I'm using this as a refresher course to go back over material I haven't looked at in awhile.\n",
      "Remember that the Google Cybersecurity Certificate is considered a lower level credential than the Security+, so I recommend continuing onto higher level certifications.\n",
      "My issue with it, normally buy the instructors study guide and take notes inside the book. Only in section 1, I seem to be writting everything down. The best part is the readings.\n",
      "There is a fine line between taking detailed notes and writing everything down. Notes should not be an exact replica of what you read or learned; instead, they should be an easy place to reference if you need to study or refresh on certain topics. Most people don't take good enough notes to be usable, at least beyond the short term, and very few take too many notes.\n",
      "Man, i just graduated with my bachelor's degree in cyber security (miami) and i started studying for my security+ 601. I started google cyber security professional cert because i felt school didnt teach me anything and now im at my witts end about what to do. I just want a decent entry level job to learn what i was actually learning to love.\n",
      "I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) where you'll find a lot of answers to the questions you're having right now and the path to take.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  thanks a lot for that! I know a good amount of theory but if I was to get a job tomorrow I wouldn't know what the heck to do.\n",
      "Yeah cybersecurity is kinda a pointless degree tbh. Most employers want certs and experience. You wouldve been better off with the A+ qnd help desk and get the network and sec+ while working. I'm getting a compsci degree but getting those certs just to keep my options open\n",
      " @Matt-jc2ml  I wouldn't say that a cyber degree is pointless, but the reality is that almost all degrees aren't cutting-edge, so you'll need to learn more and develop specific skills as your career evolves. One could also argue that a Comp Sci degree is fairly useless for most non-development jobs if we were going based purely on curriculum but there's a lot more to the value of a degree than just the courses that you took.\n",
      " @Matt-jc2ml  How do you feel now getting Compsci degree when no one can find a job with it?\n",
      " @fercoshow  wouldn't say nobody can get a job with it, it's just harder. And it's still better than cyber security because you can just get a few hundred bucks worth of certs instead, and you'll still have to do helpdesk even with a degree\n",
      "Thank you for the honest review! As someone who is new to the Cybersecurity field (I’m currently 3 courses deep into the Google Cert) I saw this very as a good way to get discounted access to the CompTIA Security + cert. In your opinion, does it seem worth it to complete the course or is that the sunk cost fallacy talking?\n",
      "You're very welcome! I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and checking out the included roadmap. Unfortunately, even if you achieved the Security+, you would still have gaps in your knowledge and will have to take steps backwards to resolve those deficiencies. The choice is ultimately yours and I understand if you want the discount, but at least you'll be aware of what's expected by employers and what you'll have to do to be ready.\n",
      "I signed up after watching multiple cybersecurity professionals recommending this course as a first step towards cybersecurity career in order to see how you like it. Finished 1 course in 3 days, currently on 2 course.  I am gonna do a bootcamp at a local community college.\n",
      "Certainly, there are plenty of low-risk options if you just want to \"try things out\" before you invest more time and money into a career field that you might not enjoy. As long as you have the proper expectations, then you'll be fine, but I wouldn't expect a job directly from it. You can find what's expected by employers in my free eBook's roadmap ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ). I'll also caution you about being careful with the resources that you consume (especially the free ones). It's not that there aren't qualified professionals making content, but many highly unqualified people are giving advice, too. Just make sure you research your resources for anything you do or use!\n",
      "6:30 minor correction that the 6 month estimate is based on 7 hours per week.  If one were to study 7 hours per day, that'd almost a full time job lol and they'd complete the course in about 3-4 weeks.\n",
      "Not a huge deal just a minor slip in wording but you are correct. They provide how many hours of training the course provides so it's fairly easy to do the math depending on how much time somebody wants to dedicate.\n",
      "My part time warehouse job at Fedex pays for courses so I took a 6 month Cyber Security course at a local college but felt that I didn't retain some of the info as I learn best with CBT based training. Full time I work for an ISP that is very Cisco (CCNA), Nokia (NRS1) and basic cloud centric but I would like to break into Cyber. Looking at taking this course then some hand-on ones like Hack the Box....\n",
      "I recommend using multiple sources (i.e., books, videos, etc.) because you might prefer a certain type of training, but some topics might stick better in your brain from a different method. I always tell people to grab my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ), which includes a roadmap of what to learn based on what will be expected in the career field. There's also nothing wrong with doing things in addition to what I've provided.\n",
      "I did it in just 4 weeks with no prior  cybersecurity knowledge but although I did have some programming knowledge and I did like how they used Python. Everything was good for someone with little or no knowledge in the field but it does open doors to study for sec+\n",
      "Everybody will have a different experience but this review is not only based on going through the course, but also with the insight of substantial Cybersecurity career and certification experience. I always aim to provide the most effective and efficient path where you get exactly what you need and will use.\n",
      "I've actually learned more about cybersecurity from Google than from the bootcamp I attended. It's really helpful and resourceful.\n",
      "I'm glad that you learned more than your bootcamp, and although that means in comparison it's better than your bootcamp, that doesn't mean that it's then a \"good\" or the \"best\" choice. Make sure that once you finish you complete the roadmap in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) because that's ultimately what will be expected.\n",
      "Thank you for this video. Now, can you please make a video on the Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate?? I would like a to do a comparison. I have no IT skills. I plan on taking the Google cybersecurity certificate next month and make my way up to sec+, cisco cyberops, BTL1, Cysa+, Casp+, etc...you can notice I haven't mentioned anything about A+ or Network+. That's because I have been told the google cert would give me all the foundational network skills I need.  Also, the 30% voucher they offer for the sec+ is appealling.\n",
      "If I have enough interest, I will certainly look at it. I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and checking out the included roadmap of certifications and skills. Also, you will absolutely not have enough foundational networking knowledge from the Google Cybersecurity Certificate...again see the roadmap for what I recommend.\n",
      "What online course/program do you recommend for beginners wanting to get into Cybersecurity?\n",
      "I always recommend visiting my Getting Started page ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) to begin your journey and to use Cyber Training Pro ( https://www.cybertrainingpro.com/ ) as a training provider. Additionally, an important thing to understand is that cybersecurity knowledge isn't something you jump directly to, but instead build up into. The reasoning is that if you don't understand how technology works, you won't understand what needs to be secured or how it needs to be secured. The resources that I've provided will get you to where you need to be so that you can have the start of a successful career.\n",
      "Thanks for this. You just gained a lot of respect from me for not parroting the typical marketing for this program\n",
      "I'm glad that you enjoyed the video! My goal is always to be honest and transparent with all my content, and this is no different.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber   I’m new to cybersecurity looking to start a career as a SOC Analyst what online course would you recommend for somebody like me with no experience and working a full time job. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated\n",
      " @ruggiero1206  I recommend that anybody looking to break into cybersecurity grab my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and check out the included roadmap.\n",
      "I’m 35 years old. I haven’t worked in 3 years because I was in a coma for 3 months back in 2021. I want to start a new career in technology. Will Coursera be good for me?\n",
      "I recommend that anybody trying to get into IT or Cybersecurity should follow the roadmap included in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ). This will give you the foundation you need to go into any area that you enjoy.\n",
      "I agree. I tried to keep my review as honest as possible for people just starting out in cyber \n",
      "\n",
      "However like you stated the lack of depth in areas and why windows wasn’t covered as it should have is a bigger issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "It also didn’t make sense to me to mention the cissp to people who can’t qualify to take it lol\n",
      "\n",
      "Good video\n",
      "Thanks for watching! Honestly, I'm just so disappointed in some of the poor choices that Google made for this program. A company with hundreds of billions of dollars in annual revenue and what they claim to be the smartest and brightest, yet this is the best they came up with.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  yeah I think it was a good first attempt. I think the main issue is making it so broad. They should just have longer courses geared at different domains\n",
      "IMHO, I'd START with getting your (similar in brackets):\n",
      "At their cost, they are better value compared to \"practice\" exams packs\n",
      "1. Google IT Support (ITF+ > A+, some Net+/Sec+/Server+)\n",
      "2. Google Cybersecurity (Sec+, abit Net+)\n",
      "3. Google IT Support Automation (A+/Net+ some Server+ ++)\n",
      "4. Google Project Management (Pro+)\n",
      "\n",
      "FIRST (A more forgiving method of certification)\n",
      "Then get CompTIA equal certs (when YOU ARE ready)\n",
      "\n",
      "Google > Its a \"better entry\" , cheaper, more modern/accepted A+, Net+, Sec+, Pro+ > \"equal\" (give it 2 years they will be as standard as CompTIA)\n",
      "There's nothing wrong with the crawl, walk, run plan...however it's not really necessary and it will definitely slow your journey down in the early phase, which is when people generally want results quick. The Google certifications also will never be comparable in the industry for many reasons but especially when they don't offer an actual proctored exam or require ongoing education.\n",
      "You legit guy. So many talk without actually taking the course!\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried the course but abandoned it, did not like it for many reasons. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for your honesty you earned a subscriber.\n",
      "I'm glad that you enjoyed the video and welcome to the community!\n",
      "So as someone who have zero knowledge and no background in computer science and wanted to learn cybersecurity what do you recommend where should he start from ?and what course he should start with to get all the basic ideas. NEED FOR SOME GUIDANCE\n",
      "It's all documented in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  I signed up for your newsletter, but I did not get your ebook.\n",
      " @curesnow6493  I recommend trying again and making sure to follow all the instructions provided.\n",
      "Thanks for this, I’m currently on Course 3 & i feel like I’m haven’t really learned too much… just a bunch of definitions they’re cramming into my head. I also believe there’s no way this is “professional” it seems super basic knowledge, I do plan on further expanding my knowledge after it though. Perhaps a associates degree & there’s places near me that offer 11mon actual irl training hands on at this one base I might look into. I’m still enjoying it though because I’m 25 and just now realizing I enjoy tech a lot & want to do something in the industry & cyber really has me excited.\n",
      "Awesome and thank you for sharing! Ultimately if you can get a job in IT or Cybersecurity and start learning the necessary skills, you'll be making solid progress towards your goals.\n",
      "If you’re getting the course for free like myself which was through a program in my city from a college’s business development program then it’s worth taking the time to complete especially if you have no prior knowledge and want a basic understanding of cybersecurity in the role of an analyst. More than that if you have the time to commit & complete it’s good for mental morale that you set a goal and see it through. I do believe this course serves a purpose to give you exposure to discovering how much more you need to learn to pass your exam and to gain an understanding of what you need to be able to apply. I’m in course 5 with three more to go and will see it through to completion. I’m also not banking on the google course alone to aid me in passing and getting an entry level job in cybersecurity.\n",
      "At the end of the day, people have to make the decision as it impacts their career, but at least they have a better understanding of the pros/cons and what to expect. As described in this video, the program has a lot left to be desired, but it's a lower risk opportunity to see if people can make it through a very introductory course as things only get more difficult from here. That said, I don't remember the last time somebody contacted me to get into the career field and being ok with slowing things down.\n",
      "As a beginner, the course is perfect to get to your feet in cybersecurity at all. Just brings some light on the career path really. But if you already have basic knowledge and already have other certs, then the Google cert will be no use to you of course!\n",
      "The Google Cybersecurity Certificate is like a very slow crawl phase of a career journey. If there weren't other more advantageous options that you could jump directly into without going through this program, then it might seem more reasonable. A very high percentage of people are ditching this course less than halfway through, so that should give you insight into what beginners think, and that's assuming you ignore the insight from somebody who's been doing this stuff for a long time (me). How do I know people are quitting? The discussion forums are part of the requirements, and there's a huge drop-off in the amount of posts.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  Agreed cause To be honest, i am halfway through the course. And i am about to ditch it as well lol. I see what they mean. The first half of the course is great to learn terms and stuff, but after like course 5, they kinda do recaps on the previous courses and it’s all the same stuff now. Just said in different ways. \n",
      "\n",
      "What do you recommend i start next? I’m new to cybersecurity. But I’m not sure if i should start the comptia A+ or go straight for the security+. Also finishing the Google cyber cert for the 30% off on the security+ is the real reason why people even finish the course tbh. I just don’t like to waste time lol\n",
      "I'm just past the halfway point and I'm just trying to get through it. It is boring but I do like the labs. Rather learn more hands on. But do the report labs actually matter in the real world?\n",
      " @kyshawntv6285  I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and checking out the included roadmap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, if you can get through the program to get the discount voucher, it might be worth it, but then again, what's your time worth? It doesn't seem to be a big enough incentive for most to finish the program, but I wouldn't argue with you if you wanted to save money.\n",
      " @bryanreed316  they simulate things that you might do in the real world, so there is value in exercises like that, but at the early stages, learning the material you need is the most important thing.\n",
      " @cyberlocc  people can skip to the other courses and come back...the order isn't forced on students. I agree that people probably struggled with the SQL and Python labs if they had no prior experience with it. I evaluated each course in addition to the overall program, and I stand by what I said for each course.\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't argue with people if they want to save money with the Security+ discount voucher. We all have to determine what our time is worth and evaluate our choices. That said, there's obviously a break-even point where you're no longer coming out ahead with the discount. \n",
      "\n",
      "The discount voucher is not a big enough selling point from my perspective if you haven't started anything yet, but as I always say, my advice is based on the most effective and efficient path possible.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber Thank you! I’ve decided to stop at the python course. They are word dumping even more and it is difficult with the way they teach. And the labs for the python course suck because it’s not hands on. I would rather learn on my own with the actual program and YouTube vids on python and SQL. And yeah the discount voucher is really not worth it, I’ve got what i needed from the courses, because now they are just milking it lol. It was fun to learn before they started to repeat themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      "Decided to go back and do the comptTIA A+ and then the security+ certifications.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  \"How do I know people are quitting? The discussion forums are part of the requirements..\" Not really, you can skip it, I did it initially but skipped all the other ones and still doing the course. It's a great course. Is it going to land me a job? No, probably not. But i never expected it to.\n",
      "Alright, I kinda change my mind. I agree with you. Certificates are worthless unless it teaches you how to do the job vs just giving you a piece of paper like a liberal arts degree. However, anything is better that nothing and it shows employers your possible dedication to learning the trade. But nothing beats actually learning the trade and being obsessed with the craft vs just trying to get a job via a piece of paper alone.\n",
      "Certifications have never really been about just \"getting the paper\" as the value has always been in the information that you learn. That said, if an employer values specific certifications, they can be helpful in getting an interview/job but they certainly aren't the only piece of the puzzle. The key point is that if employers didn't care which certifications that you have, they wouldn't list specific ones in a job posting. Although you may see several possible certifications in a job posting, there's intent behind why they list the options they do and to ignore that is not beneficial in your career. Specifically regarding the Google Cybersecurity Certificate...there's good/fast paths and bad/slow paths and there's plenty of reasons why the Google certificate isn't on the good/fast path.\n",
      "Similar in how a lot of people see the CISSP a mile wide and an inch deep in content, but with this, I would say at best, this is only a half a inch deep. I will say for a person that is inquisitive, it left me wanting to learn more. Not going over Windows and AD is something I realized I should have learned before even being exposed a threat, vulnerability, or risk, incident response, wireshark, python ect. I always felt it should have been redone and behave like the BTL1 cert operates in being lab heavy in all their courses.\n",
      "I don't really expect an entry level certification to go very deep into the topics but this certificate definitely has a long ways to go in many areas.\n",
      "I treated the course as a general introduction to cybersecurity so that I could really confirm I held interest in pursuing it. I had very low expectations for the career group access or even getting any responses on their boards (which was dismal most of the time). But I do feel it served its purpose, and I finished it within about a month so I think I ended up paying the 50 bucks. Wasn't too bad.\n",
      "Thank you for sharing! The best audience for something like this is really the people who aren't sure if it's the right career field for them, although the lab exercises are more difficult than what makes sense for the audience. That said, much of the marketing leads people to believe it will prepare them for the career field, but it doesn't come close from a proficiency standpoint.\n",
      "The one possible plus for the Google Cyber security is the Sec+ coucher.\n",
      "That's assuming you complete the course and get the voucher in under 2 months. Even as somebody who knows this stuff, it took quite a bit of time to get through the courses. I did condense a lot of it into a short period of time but that's not normal for somebody new to cybersecurity.\n",
      "I took the IT fundamentals course provided by coursera as I don’t have any certificates yet I’ve been in my MSP lvl 1 tech role for a year and want to move on to a specialization i picked cybersecurity and have no idea which certs I should go with there being soc, sec, cissp, and all kinds of roles while I think if your an absolute beginner and no nothing about computer I do think the fundamentals is a good start as a supplement with studying for comptia a+ security+ or network and possibly a ccna.\n",
      "I never said that the fundamentals weren't necessary but somewhere along the way, there is this misconception that fundamentals means everything has to be stripped down to an extremely basic level. The reality is that there is a ton of entry-level focused training that has worked for years, however, the real issue is that people aren't doing the additional things to make themselves more competitive...and with a lot more competition trying to enter the career field, it becomes a more difficult task to stand out.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  I agree that there are a lot of entry level training courses/programs available I think there is a lot of not a very general or laid out path for specializations as there are tons and tons of different certifications. What are your thoughts on getting into cyber security and where would one start or should start?\n",
      " @The_Egg_Studio  Specializations mean little to nothing when you're first starting out. It's almost like trying to put the roof on a house that has no base/foundation. As you gain experience and knowledge, you naturally start to lean towards a certain type of job, and that's when you start diving deeper into an area and not wider. The early stages are the same regardless of the path that you want to pursue and it's all documented in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "Half way through the course. agree most things with you..would you review the microsoft one as well?\n",
      "Agreed would love your take on the microsoft one as well.\n",
      "make that a 3 rd behind Yukisome and arto.\n",
      "I'll definitely take a look into it. For a high-level review though, you still have a similar issue with the job market where employers aren't asking for the certification. Looking at the content itself, it appears to be built to give you some immediate skills but you're not going to have broad knowledge of security as it's highly focused on building those specific skills.\n",
      "I share your point of view. I would say that this course is just an appetizer and will never guarantee you to land a job, unless a company is willing to continue training you.\n",
      "This course is a foundational help to continue your learning journey. I decided to take the SOC path and with only the Google course nobody will give me a job.\n",
      "Tons of knowledge and technical additional stuff are necessary to learn before even to think about an internship, for example.\n",
      "The reality is that companies get massive interest when they post cybersecurity jobs, so they don't really feel obligated to give complete training from the ground up. This is a career field where if you want to be successful, you have to take ownership of your career and find the options that will advance your situation. It's certainly not \"easy\" but if you put in the work doing the things that matter, you can certainly set yourself apart.\n",
      "Well I think the google cyber certificate is one of the best as I have taken a A few months of this certs, it touched on thing other certs or courses never touched\n",
      "My insight comes from significant industry experience and achieving many recognized certifications but it's up to you if you want to receive the information. I'm not sure which certifications that you've taken but any of the choices that I would recommend absolutely cover the content included in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, and beyond.\n",
      "You mentioned it will take 6 months to complete if you study 7 hours per day. That sounds intimidating for a basic course. Did you mean per week?\n",
      "Thank you for a detailed review!\n",
      "Great job paying attention! They say \"6 months at 7 hours a week.\"\n",
      "How long did it take you to finish the course?\n",
      "I really appreciate this candid review. I was thinking of taking this course as a refresher before diving into my Sec+ studies since I got a month of Coursera for $1. I'm thinking I'll apply that effort in another direction.\n",
      "You're welcome and I'm glad that you found the review helpful!\n",
      "You really should. 30% off that expensive security + I'd you take it.\n",
      "Ya I took it as study material for the Sec+, he is being a little harsh and basing this review on \"you wont get a job with this alone\" which ya clearly, but as Security+ study material and some python, its great. \n",
      "\n",
      "They also say to not take this without the other google certs that already teach windows and networking, so thats a large aspect of him saying this sucks, but he is ignoring that aspect. They assume knowledge from the other certs that they tell you to take first.\n",
      " @cyberlocc  the website and all the marketing around the Google Cybersecurity Certificate absolutely infers that the certificate alone can lead to a job. Tell Google and Coursera to stop pushing that narrative the way they are, but until then, the statement is accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "They say no such thing about requiring any prerequisite knowledge going into the course.\n",

      "Google FAQ (  )\n",
      "Q: Who is the Cybersecurity Certificate for?\n",
      "A: You! No prior cybersecurity experience or specific knowledge is required. All you need is an interest in solving puzzles, investigating, and helping others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coursera FAQ (  )\n",
      "Q: What background knowledge is necessary?\n",
      "A: No background knowledge or experience in the field of cybersecurity necessary.\n",
      "Q: So what is a beginner to do if you're interested in cybersecurity? I see so many different sites advertising the same.It almost sounds like taking the A+ or the Regular Google IT support cert is the best way to start (before taking any security cert). Any thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated! \n",
      "As I mentioned earlier, your opinion is much appreciated  \n",
      "\n",
      "But tbh most if the certs are just to get past the gatekeeper who usually know next to nothing about the job. \n",
      "\n",
      "So long as they point us in the right direction for us to do some due diligence on our own & speak to the basics in an interview, it serves its purpose.\n",
      "Thanks for watching! With certifications, if you treat them in that way, you certainly aren't going to get all the value possible from them. Certifications are only one piece to the puzzle to making you a competitive candidate...not the only piece. That said, not all certifications are created nor valued the same and it's a massive mistake to make decisions purely on your perception while ignoring the perception of the person/company who you want to hire/pay you.\n",
      "I've been researching a career change into cyber for a few weeks now and I've yet to encounter anyone knowledgeable and credible who's #1 sponsored or #2 hasn't demonstrated that they haven't taken any of the courses they're reviewing. After years in a certain area in the military, it's somewhat easy to spot a BSer fairly early in some of these videos. You mentioned that this cert belongs in the \"trash\" but I didn't catch your recommendation(s) as a better alternative to newbies looking to get started\n",
      "Given that I have significant experience in the industry and with certifications, I didn't necessarily need to take the program to evaluate it based on the content covered and the employability impact. Still, it certainly allows me to talk about the student experience aspect. You can find all my recommendations in my eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) for anybody trying to start working or break into Cybersecurity from a related field.\n",
      "@JonGoodCyber  OK. At first glance, and maybe I'm wrong, but it looks like you're selling something, which is probably why I didn't hear you mention any alternatives to the Google cert path. I'll take some time this weekend and go through your play lists. I'm trying to develop a plan to be prepared for a career change from transportation logistics into cyber by the end of Feb '24. Thanks for the reply\n",
      "I absolutely have training and career services that people can enroll in based on the path I recommend, but it has nothing to do with the review itself. If people don't want to use my offerings, that's their choice, but the path is available to all and should still be used regardless.\n",
      "Q: Is there anything comparable or superior to the Google Cert for someome who wants a general introduction into Cybersecurity?\n",
      "If you're looking for a general introduction, it really doesn't matter much about what you take because you aren't trying to build the required professional skills. If I were in that situation, I would look on Udemy for a course, or you can continue working through free videos on YouTube from myself and others. Either way, I wouldn't be spending much money if that's your only intention.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are actually interested in working in the career field, you'll want to follow my free eBook's roadmap (  ).\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  yeah, the goal is to prepare myself to start learning skills to enter the field, but I am starting from scratch. I'll explore the ebook as well. Thank you.\n",
      "Thanks for this. I just finished the Sec+ training vid (Cert tbd). This GCP was next. I heard so much good out of it but this honest review saved me time and $$, 2 resources in short supply lately.\n",
      "Glad it was helpful!\n",
      "This course alone may not be able to land you a job right away but it will teach you a lot and give you a great foundation to get you started and is affordable. It helped me pass the Security+.\n",
      "Congrats on passing your Security+! You basically said it yourself by saying the program won't help you land a job, which it will not. I've never had anybody tell me they want training that won't directly impact their employability because it just doesn't make sense from a career perspective. Regardless, if somebody decides to take the program, I'll always be here to help them accelerate their journey and make up for lost time. I don't waste time on past decisions with my students, instead, we look at where you are at currently and how to get where you want to be from there.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  Good point Mr.Good !\n",
      "Thank you for not selling out and telling us the truth.\n",

      "Geez finally a REAL review I thought it would never happen. Thank you \n",

      "Is there something you would recommend instead?\n",
      "All of my recommendations are listed in my free eBook's roadmap ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) along with other helpful information.\n",
      "Good evening Jon! Good video; I agree with you that there were a ton of reviews which had what felt like a layer of bias lol The Security+ discount is something worth mentioning but overall I agree with your points! Keep up the good work!\n",
      "Thanks for watching and I appreciate the support!\n",
      "I chat GPT’d this course in my current role (Systems Administrator) and leveraged it for a raise. \n",
      "I’m currently studying for my CISSP but needed a little bonus on my yearly review lol\n",
      "If your employer is valuing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate enough to give you a raise, get as much legitimate money from them as possible because they clearly don't know what's up.\n",
      "Thanks Jon! I thought the same thing, when the clowns started pushing that certification. No employer is asking for that certification but they push it like it’s the best thing that ever came out. Since your doing this one how about doing simplelearn courses too. There is a YouTuber who says they are the top ten courses and certifications. I told her no employer ever ask or heard of that crap!. Thanks again\n",
      "I'm glad that you enjoyed the video! If I get enough interest, I'll certainly look at the courses.\n",
      "I took and completed it only because you get a 30% discount for the Security+. It took me only 1 month and saved me roughly $100. Still needed alot of additional work though to study for the exam.\n",
      "Don't you mean a discount on the Security+? I'm certainly not saying that going through the program will hinder your career outlook, but like a lot of things, you have to evaluate each situation's pros and cons.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  you're right it was the security+\n",
      "HOW TO TAKE IT FOR FREE: Check with your library! My library has free access to Coursera, I wouldn't've been able to take the course without it!\n",
      "You should always take advantage of benefits like that when they are available.\n",
      "Where do you navigate that \"library\" ??\n",
      "So if you don’t have any type of knowledge about cybersecurity but interested in learning, where would you recommend starting?\n",
      "The best place to start is grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) where I provide a lot of information including a roadmap of skills and certifications to pursue.\n",
      "This course isnt of any value in the job market but it’ll definitely help you test the water before diving into it.\n",
      "Honestly, there are better methods that are either free (i.e., YouTube) or very low-cost (Udemy) if you want to test the waters without spending much time. Somebody starting out will likely take a few months or more to work through this program and not get much in return. That's $100 that you can definitely spend more wisely.\n",
      "I will preface that i don't think this cert is a replacement for Security +. Sec + is the baseline cert to have. With that said.... While I appreciate your full review and take on this, I would have to disagree that it belongs in the trash. I think it's a fresh take on introducing the same tired material we all drone on. I do like that there are a variety of people offering their stories of getting into the industry as well as some descriptions of what they do in the field. Most trainings I've seen are just shotgun bootcamp style trainings to pass a test. There is a lack of hands on training for people that are just studying theory for certs. I also would say that while Python might not be a requirement, it is definitely a skill to level up from someone that is a monitor of a network. There's a wide variety of skills and focuses and I think the course has done a great job of introducing this material with very short courses so it's not overwhelming.\n",
      "You are welcome to your opinion, and you certainly don't have to always (or ever) agree with me. The reality is that the objective of certifications is to help people get jobs, and if a certification doesn't achieve that, then its value is minimal, if there is any in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a training program that makes some substantial promises, formally or informally, it has significant misses in preparing a new professional, as documented in the video. One common misconception I often see with newer professionals is that they think hands-on skills are the only thing that matters, which couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, hands-on skills change much more rapidly than concepts, so if you don't understand the concepts, you'll be obsolete fairly quickly. Another common misconception is that certifications like the Security+ are all theory. Per the exam objectives, you are responsible for various tools that, although basic, tend to be what gets used quite often. Last, the coding language is a long discussion, and although it can be beneficial, it's nowhere near the top of the list of the things you should be learning so early, and its value is limited to specific jobs.\n",
      "So what course would you recommend? I have zero knowledge of anything related to cybersecurity but I want to start somewhere & I’m considering Coursera just because it’s something and not nothing and is priced relatively cheap.\n",
      "All of my recommendations can be found in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "If I already have security+ is this course still worth doing? Attempting to gain all the certs I can because I only hold an associates degree. My other option would be to obtain a BS.\n",
      "I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ), which includes the roadmap of certifications and skills that anybody trying to get into the career field should follow, as that's what employers will expect. Simply having the Security+ doesn't mean you've satisfied all the required knowledge to that point, as most haven't, but again, that's all addressed in my free eBook.\n",
      "Do you have a take on the Microsoft version?\n",
      "It's very focused on Microsoft offerings, which, in many cases, might be more realistic. That said, you don't get as wide of exposure, so there are pros and cons to that. From an employer demand standpoint, the Microsoft version is also not in high demand.\n",
      "I think google course serves it's role perfect. It won't land you a job, but it probably the best intro for a newbie in cybersecurity, and is good prep leading into the first real cert that holds some weight, sec+\n",
      "The primary goal of certifications is to get you an interview/job, plain and simple. If somebody wants to take the program, that's completely fine, but at least after this video, they'll be aware of the problems with the program. Additionally, going from this program to the Security+, doesn't resolve significant knowledge/skill gaps and isn't a path I would endorse. Too often today, beginners are looking for a single program that gives them everything they need immediately instead of doing the things that actually work and will prepare them for the career field.\n",
      "Yea I already knew most of the things that’s on this cert and I 100% don’t believe that you can’t get a job off this but I have to see for myself when ever my contract ends.\n",
      "From what I've seen, the small amount of people able to land a job after this are very entry level positions in IT Support or help desk. Although getting into a tech-related job is great, there are certainly more efficient and effective ways to do it.\n",
      "I mean, if you finish in four days you didn’t actually go through the course you just skipped through all the lessons and videos, and then took the tests. How would you know if it’s a good course or not?\n",
      "Based on your comment...just to clarify, I've been in this career field for a long time and have a lot of training/education to understand what's necessary and what's not. I wasn't learning the content for the first time.\n",
      "Would you recommend for someone who has not the slightest clue of anything cyber security\n",
      "You can find my recommendations included in my free eBook's roadmap ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "Hi Jon. I really appreciated your video. But as a novice who is trying to understand the mysteries of this incredible new world, I was under the impression that this Google Certificate would at least guide me in a direction. One thing that I would have appreciated is alternatives. If this certificate is not up to par with the industry's current standards, what pathways would you suggest for someone like me to begin learning and growing? I look forward to reading your response.\n",
      "I'm glad that you enjoyed the video! As a beginner, one of the most difficult things to do is to see beyond the immediately visible options. That has nothing to do with you specifically but because you don't have enough context for how things work in the career field over time. Alternatives were not part of the scope of this video, which specifically focused on reviewing the program. I recommend starting with my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ), in which I've included a roadmap and additional information to help you on your journey.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  Thank you, Jon, for your directions. I'll read your book tonight and continue to follow your newsletter as well.\n",
      "Hey Jon, I stumbled onto your channel as I’m trying to get validation for this course as I’m currently taking it. I’m about finishing up course 2 and  after watching your video I’m kind of second guessing on finishing off this program. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q: what is the preferred route to take for learning/studying? \n",
      "\n",
      "I was thinking of picking up a compTia network and security + at my local bookstore & learning  from there. I’m taking the google course only cause I’m new to the IT field and don’t know too much terms and how everything works but I’m willing to put in the time and effort to learn it. Also google cert helps prepare for the compTia sec+ exam all the more reasons I am taking this course. \n",

      "Much mahalos,\n",
      "\n",
      "Dom\n",
      "I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ), which includes a roadmap of skills and certifications to pursue.\n",
      "I know my page is about fishing but my day job is in IT. I finished the course in 7 days. As a seasoned IT professional with over 20 + years of experience I used it as review and to get ready for the CompTIA Security + exam. I think it's a good course for beginners. Will you get a job after you complete it? It doesn't hurt to have it but you won't have people knocking down your door.\n",
      "Thank you for watching! Sometimes people get the misconception that I'm saying the information will somehow harm you from advancing and that's certainly not what I'm saying. The fact is that there are many possible paths but as is the case with the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, you will be following a slower paced path that really doesn't progress your career enough to make it worthwhile. Efficiency and effectiveness are the name of the game when it comes to picking the best path.\n",
      "So what do you recommend for a beginner?\n",
      "All of my recommendations can be found in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) including a roadmap to follow.\n",
      "I took the course last month as someone with no cybersecurity experience. Now studying for my Security + attempt next week I'm finding that the Google Cybersecurity Professional course didn't help me at all while preparing for this exam. Also that voucher discount code for 30% off can be found online. Anyone considering the course: don't waste your time\n",
      "Thank you for sharing! You are accurate in that the Google program barely scratches the surface of anything covered on the Security+ in the 2 to 4 months that most people are likely to spend on the material. That time spent can absolutely be better spent elsewhere.\n",
      "Im looking at taking a google cert or two but im new to the world of computers outsid eif basic use. Where should i start as I wanna get into the IT field.\n",
      "If you are looking at starting a career, then I highly recommend following the roadmap in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "Thanks for your honesty.  Too many influencers hawk these courses and I'm glad you called it out.  Whenever someone shoves a course in my face, I click away from the video.\n",
      "Glad it was helpful! It's not that somebody creating a course is somehow inherently bad, but in the wider landscape of the Internet, it's gotten really out of control with garbage information/training.\n",
      "6:35 small mistake, they say 7 hours a  WEEK not per day if you want to complete in 6 months\n",
      "Yep already mentioned several times but not a big deal. They state it right on the page and the amount of hours covered, but also everybody's timeline is going to vary anyways. Thanks for watching!\n",
      "Thank you for this review.  I was considering taking it just for the 30% off the voucher and additional knowledge. I have already taken a Sec+ instructor led class, just completed my A+ and Net+ but had to leave the program I was in and might not get a voucher. I’m also coming from 20 years in the military and having a tough time getting an “entry level” job for whatever reason.  Do you think in my case this would still be a waste of time?? I feel like I can bang it out in a week or two which would make the discounted voucher and extra experience worth it…or should I just knock the Sec+ out and roll the dice?  Either way, I need to get an IT job somewhere or this will all be for just personal knowledge haha\n",
      "Was your military experience in IT? Without knowing more about your situation, seeing your resume, knowing the types of jobs you're applying to, etc. it's fairly difficult to identify the actual problem preventing you from landing a job.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, this is something where it's never \"worth it\" from a career standpoint, but if you want to fly through it just to get the discount, I'm not going to fight you on it because you do obviously save some money with the discount. Just make sure that you have the proper expectations based on what I've said in this video and because you're not really going to learn or retain much flying through any program in a week. Also, based on the training that you've already done, you're not really the target audience as you most likely know or have been exposed to a lot of the covered information.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  ah ok got it, and yea I’m new to IT. At the beginning of my career, I had a stint where I did networking with windows NT/2000 but that was A LONG time ago haha. I’m just trying to broaden my horizons to get my foot in the door but maybe just getting that Sec+ is the better choice. I figured I’d get a different perspective with the Google one, just to better my overall understanding. Net+ was hard as hell!\n",
      " @jfisher164  Honestly, the beginning can be challenging since the majority of topics are new, and it's the first time that you see the information. Additionally, it's because you have to cover a ton of information to build your foundation. I also recommend checking out Cyber Training Pro ( https://www.cybertrainingpro.com/ ) where we have a lot of training and career services to help out.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  thanks man! I appreciate all that you do!\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  also, I’ve just decided to strike while the iron is hot. I’ve gotten the last two in less than a month, I can crush sec+ in the next few weeks.  Thanks again, subscribed!\n",

      "You finished it on 17th Sep and I started it 2 days later. It took me a month to complete and it felt quite overwhelming to me because I was and still am completely new to Cybersecurity.\n",
      "If you didn't like this course, you definitely don't like Coursera in general, because in my experience, the Google Courses are the most well-structured that I tried there. I started the IBM course before starting the Google one and it was really shitty: poor audio quality and very amateur PowerPoint presentations, for instance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I liked the course but I have been doing projects and trying other platforms because I feel like I keep forgetting most of the stuff. More than 8 or 9 months have passed since I started taking Cyber courses and I'm still lost and haven't landed my 1st job yet.\n",

Any course for somebody brand new to the career field will feel overwhelming because frankly, everything that you're learning in the beginning is likely new to you and there's a lot to cover to build your foundation. That's not to say that somehow the information is going to somehow hurt your ability to grasp other information or that I simply \"hate\" Coursera, but the reality is the certifications with any value are meant to help you get a job and the Google Cybersecurity Certificate falls well short of that goal to make you a qualified professional. If you had an ok experience, that's fine, but you'll see that as you progress, there's a lot left to be desired. Keep in mind that I'm speaking as somebody who's been in the industry for a while and understands what you need to be successful and has been through A LOT of training in my career.\n",

      "I took this course and finished it in 6 weeks thinking it would prepare me for the security + exam.  I then took a practice exam and was stumped. I don't see how anyone can pass that exam with this course alone.\n",
      "What course would you recommend for starting in cyber security?\n",
      "I recommend beginning your journey with Zero to Cyber Pro ( https://www.cybertrainingpro.com/p/zero-to-cyber-pro ) to give you a good foundation.\n",
      "I am a newbie wannabe in cyber security. Your video definitely tells a lot about google cyber security. Hope that google take you input seriously.\n",
      "My question is. What is the difference between cyber security and a white hat hacker? Are they same or different. Can a cyber security analyst identify themselves as white hat hacker or vice versa? What knowledge differs them?\n",
      "\"A white hat hacker -- or ethical hacker -- is an individual who uses hacking skills to identify security vulnerabilities in hardware, software or networks.\" Essentially, white hat hackers are a subset of individuals within Cyber Security, so all white hat hackers are considered within Cyber Security...but all Cyber Security professionals aren't necessarily white hat hackers since not everybody is interested in or focused on hacking.\n",

      " @JonGoodCyber  thanks a lot!!!\n",
      "What should we take instead????\n",
      "You can find my recommendations in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "Thanks for your unbiased view. I’m studying bsc cybersecurity, just completed my first ever semester and i feel like i’m getting robbed.\n",
      "You're welcome! Often, people don't have the proper expectations of a degree program due to a variety of reasons that aren't always self-imposed. Looking at the bigger picture for most people, having an affordable degree is always better than not having a degree when it comes to the job market...so don't be discouraged and learn as much as you can!\n",
      "Great video! I’m currently starting out with Microsoft’s cybersecurity course. It sounds very similar to Google’s course but with an emphasis on Azure and Windows. In the video you mentioned how Google focused on Linux instead of Windows. Does Microsoft’s course holds more value than Google’s because of it?\n",
      "I'm glad that you enjoyed it! Are you talking about Microsoft courses on Coursera or something else? If so, the value might be slightly higher but the main fact is that Coursera itself isn't in high-demand by employers. There are well established credentials/certifications in the industry and Coursera isn't on that list so it really depends on what your goal is by doing the course. That said, knowledge is rarely a bad thing as long as you have the proper expectations.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  Yes, the Coursera one. I’m treating the Microsoft course as a building block towards towards Sec+ and getting a cloud cert. I have no expectations as far as landing a job once I finish the Microsoft cert. Thank you for taking the time to respond!\n",
      "I've seen people tier list them. It ends up low to mid due to Sec + being the bread and butter of getting a job in sec and with google cert it's the new kid on the block that HR doesn't know that much about, let alone interviewers. If they don't know or trust it, then it's useless as a cert. The only bonus is you can finish it for free (If you can finish it in 7 days, $50 something a month, also a small discount off sec +, so I heard.)\n",
      "I find that nearly all of these \"tier lists\" end up being worthless and I don't recommend them to my students. Much of the value of a certification beyond the actual content delivered is the recognition by employers, which this has almost none beyond the \"Google\" name. Last I checked the discount off the Security+ was around 30% so to get any substantial discount, you probably need to finish it within a month or less.\n",
      "Witch course should we go for then ? Witch certification should we get ?\n",
      "You can find all my recommendations in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "You completed the entire certificate in 4 days? Did I hear you right? If so how many hours per day?\n",
      "It would have been even quicker if I didn't have to click through every step along the way. Keep in mind that I'm not new to the career field so I didn't have to learn the information. It will take somebody new quite a bit longer to complete the program.\n",
      "The content is better than sec+, but not as recognized.  You also get a discount for sec+. so it's a good idea to get both.\n",
      "I'm not really sure how the content is \"better\" as the majority of the content covered in the Google program is also covered in the Security+. Remember that Coursera is the delivery platform of the Google program and many providers deliver training for the Security+ (some better than others)...so be careful not to confuse the delivery platform with the actual topics covered. The content isn't \"bad\"...it's just not the most efficient and effective way to getting into the career field.\n",
      "Look , as someone who has a professional certificate from an actual university and has obtained two college degrees, I am here to tell you that these professional certificates are just to get your foot in the door. These courses are there to give you core information and if Coursera has left anything out of the learning curve like, Windows and etc, then you will pick that up as you go. If you want everything covered in your certificate, you need to go to college and learn the science from ground up and all of that missing information can be learned there. Some peoples expectations are too high, 39.99$ a month is not tuition. It is a subscription fee for data and information that you may complete by a reputable and professional source though. I hope that helps moving forward.\n",
      "I'm not exactly sure if you were trying to discredit me with the first sentence...but for clarification, I have two degrees (bachelor's and master's), lots of highly sought-after industry certifications, many hours of training, and significant/successful experience in the industry, so I'm certainly in a position to make these statements. Anyways, you are accurate in that no certification OR degree will cover everything, but there is absolutely an expectation that mandatory topics will be covered. I'm not sure where $39.99 came from because Coursera is $49 per month, but just because a known company like Google makes a course/program doesn't automatically take it from subpar to amazing or even acceptable.\n",
      "Python is great but I don't think I have ever seen a SOC1 position that requires it.  I am a strong believer that you should learn a programing language and Python is very common in security but not needed for many positions.\n",
      "That's because Python isn't a mandatory skill for a level 1 (junior, entry level, etc.) SOC role. Although not mandatory for most roles, people can certainly benefit from the knowledge long term and indeed Python, Bash, and PowerShell are the three most used languages in Cybersecurity.\n",
      "So which certificate you recommend for a newbie who has no knowledge about cyber security and wants to prepare himself for Sec+???\n",
      "You can find my recommendations for anybody trying to get into Cyber Security in my free eBook's roadmap ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "Thank you for your honesty. I agree that comprehending Windows security is key in cybersecurity due to its widespread use. Glossing over essential aspects of Windows security is not ok! As a beginner transitioning into cybersecurity, I don't find it worthwhile to get the Google certificate. I think I will get the Sec+ and begin my practical, hands-on training.\n",

      "TLDR: do you think this course would be good to dip my toes in the water as a high schooler?\n",
      "Being in high school doesn't change my opinion of the program, as the facts are the facts. I recommend working through the roadmap in my eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) because that will give you a solid foundation and is ultimately what employers seek. If you're planning on going to university/college, I encourage you to take your time and learn the content since you aren't likely to be entering the workforce for a while. If you're going straight to work, then still take your time, but obviously, you will use the knowledge quicker.\n",
      "Thanks for the honesty! I'm starting with some AWS certs an was thinking of doing this after for some extra knowledge..what would you recommend in addition to this to study for sec+?\n",
      "I'm glad that you enjoyed the content! I recommend using Cyber Training Pro to prepare for the Security+ as have both 601 and 701 resources ( https://www.cybertrainingpro.com/ ).

      "Fun fact. Chrome OS, is a Linux-based operating system developed and designed by Google\n",
      "Like any operating system, it has it's place. Although Chrome OS isn't nearly as present in the enterprise world as the consumer world.\n",
      "Google Technical Support Certificate deals with mostly windows but they also push the chrome OS as well. The google cybersecurity course helps with preparation for security+ and with the concept of Linux system, it is shown base on the fact that most pen testers use it for EH and windows is barely used for it.\n",
      "Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking are a tiny subset of the job openings in cyber security and an even smaller percentage of the overall jobs that exist. That said, and to clarify, I never said that knowing Linux is a bad thing. Still, the reality is that the Windows operating system makes up a significant part of what is deployed in organizations, and we have to protect it in this career field.\n",
      "I earned my IT SUPPORT SPECIALIST CERTIFICATION.  Almost done with Data Analytics,  continues with cyber and other's.  Hope those steps helps me more .

      "I'm glad that you are enjoying the content!\n",
      "8:46 That's a huge plus, IMO. Windows is a technical fail of an operating system. If there are businesses using Windows for their servers, they're already beyond repair (It's not like this is the case anyways because Linux and BSD servers are the overwhelming majority). And those businesses should also switch to Linux for their desktops as well. In Germany, SUSE Linux Desktop is widely adopted, and it's only going to get even more adoption into the future. So you should forget about all your Windows skills because that OS is going to become obsolete sooner or later especially with their new rumored subscription model for Windows 12.\n",
      "Linux will never be widely adopted as a standard operating system for users within enterprise environments. I've heard huge fans of Linux making the claim that your stating for years yet it never comes even close to being a reality. It's true that Linux/Unix is occasionally used for backend operations depending on what's required, but even then you still most commonly have Windows running the infrastructure, managing security policies and users among other things.\n",

      "I'm glad that you enjoyed the video!\n",
      "Overall, would you say that the Google course gives a boost for someone looking to prepare and earn an industry certification (comptia security+) in cyber security?\n",
      "I've already given a lot of my thoughts in this video but the \"boost\" is so minimal that I would never even mention it because it's not a game changer. You'll still have a lot of ground to cover for the Security+ after completing the Google Cybersecurity certificate.\n",
      "Google Cybersecurity Certification is great. I don’t understand this video. I’m not saying it’s 100% good but it does the job. 70-80%. I plan to take the Security + after the new one in November and I know I’m gonna have to study all my notes and a few extra things that the new exam will have.\n",
      "Based on your comment it sounds like you are either just starting out or very early in your career journey so I'm not sure how you can say that it does 70-80% of the job (or for the Security+), as you don't have enough context at that career point. This review is backed by my significant experience in both the industry and with certifications, and I think it's a huge mistake to disregard the information provided in this video, but that's your choice.

      "My first recommendation is always to follow the roadmap in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ), which provides consistent results and will properly prepare you for a successful career. Honestly, I've had students land jobs before completing the roadmap but it's more than enough to land a job. If you've completed the roadmap and apply to 400 jobs without an interview, then something is wrong with your resume 100 percent of the time...assuming you aren't applying to unrealistic jobs for your level. If you've applied to 400 jobs...get interviews...but can't land a job, then you're interviewing skills need to be improved.

      "It’s definitely surface level. But then again, the focus is on getting a SOC Analyst position.\n",
      "Too often, like with this program, people look at the training in isolation. Like all my content, my review looks at the program with a holistic perspective and how it impacts a professional's career. There are more issues with the program than it's worth for any area of cybersecurity (SOC or other), and there are far better ways to not only begin a career but also accelerate your career journey. It should be a major warning sign that the limited amount of people who luck into a job after this program are only landing basic entry-level support jobs...not actual cybersecurity jobs. This program won't destroy your chances of eventually ending up in a cybersecurity job, but you still have quite a bit of ground to make up to qualify for the career field.\n",
      "Absorb all info you can just dont expect a job from any degree or any certs its a combo of those things and entry level work. I can see benefiting from it before taking professor messer course back when i took security plus. It serves a purpose. People have no concept of what to deep dive in in the beginning\n",

The fact that you made it crystal clear you took it, got it, and are providing feedback about an ostensibly important cert.  Now, i am convinced that this cert isn't all of what i've heard.

As far as internships, at least in the United States, these are typically limited to students currently enrolled at a college or university and can be found by either looking at company websites or occasionally on job boards like Indeed. That isn't always the case for eligibility but honestly, if you can find a job instead of an internship in either a help desk, IT department or Cybersecurity team to start gaining experience, it's a lot more valuable than an internship.\n",

      " @dineshmekbrown5042  the majority of my content and the advice that I give is universal and isn't location-dependent. That said, I am in the United States so you'll undoubtedly need to do some research to verify if a specific certification or framework/standard is common in other locations, but that's about all the kinds of differences you're going to see.\n",
      "What would be the alternative?\n",
      "I always recommend checking the description of my videos because there will always be resources related to the content. You can find the path I recommend in my free eBook's roadmap for skills and certifications ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",

      "I like how there's multiple people saying how much it helped them in passing Sec+, yet Jon is replying to them all like nooooo it's not good\n",
      "I’ve never said that there isn’t some overlap in the material, however it’s not comprehensive of all the Security+ objectives, nor does it go deep enough. I’m here to get people the best jobs possible in the most effective and efficient way possible and that’s what I do on a daily basis, while some people still insist on learning lessons the hard way.\n",
      "Do you think I would be better served taking a different job that would pay for my full degree in cyber security even tho it’s not in cyber security they will pay for associate,bachelor, and masters as long as I work there\n",
      "First, you have to be careful with employers saying they will pay for degrees because often, they will only pay for degrees/training related to your job. They also usually make you work for them for a certain amount of time after completing the program. Second, a degree is not a firm requirement in general for the career field, and I certainly wouldn't let an employer hold me hostage when I could start working on breaking into the career field and then figure out how to get the degree if still desired.\n",
      "Where should we get a online certificate then if not from google?\n",
      "You can find my recommendations in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ), which includes a roadmap to complete.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  ok I’ll check it out then\n",
      "Thank you very much! I'm an argentinian Systems Engineer (Similar to a Cs. Science Bachelor) that is trying to make his way into cybersec, and all the people are talking like you'd get this certificate and land a job instantly. Do you think that I could land a job with my degree and only one cert /course ?? Greetings\n",
      "I always recommend people follow the roadmap in my free eBook ( https://www.cybertrainingpro.com/ ) as that's what's going to be expected of any professional. That said, I've helped people break into the industry with no certifications up to several certifications. It's all about the \"total package\" that you bring to the table, and most of the time, beginners don't bring enough to the table to bypass certifications.\n",
      "So is it not free? Google is advertising to sign up free... do they just hide the cost until after?\n",
      "There is technically no cost to sign up and get the free trial but once that ends, you'll be required to pay. Google really does try to make it seem like it's free but that's just a marketing tactic to get you to feel invested in the program. Once you start signing up, you'll see more information about the cost.\n",
      "Got my Sec+ in Oct 2023 and still have not landed a job, I cant even get help desk to give me an interview. I was told i should get this certificate to add to my Sec+ and it should help but now after watching this I must go back to drawing board :(\n",
      "I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and working through the included roadmap as those are the skills and certifications that employers expect. Additionally, I recommend watching my video on resumes because that can be another massive limiting factor in your application.\n",
      "You might also want to update your résumé \n",
      "Do you other certifications ?\n",
      "What s funny enough, I got a problem with their IT Support Professional cert. Their networking part of the course to be precise. One of the reasons why I went with the IT Fundamental Plus cert\n",
      "There seems to be consistent issue themes across many courses from Google and Coursera.\n",
      "Hahah me too a recently completed it and it was rough… not a great course but it did help I won’t lie\n",
      "Q= So it would be safe to say for a rookie like myself. To start from ground zero, this would be a good path.\n",
      "I recommend following the roadmap in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "Thanks a lot for this great review! Which equivalent course would you recommend that would cover what google claims to cover?\n",
      "Not from an employers poibt of view but rather as someone that needs the experience and knowledge as a freelancer\n",
      "I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and checking out the included roadmap. As far as being a freelancer, it doesn't really change anything except your bar to entry is much higher because you should be a subject matter expert. Bug Bounty Programs are the most common form of freelancer role that exist and you'll need a pretty good base of knowledge to start finding them.\n",
      "What do you recommend?\n",
      "All my recommendations are in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "Kool research. Much appreciated. Myaon question is, if I'm a mechanic with home computer experience would this get me into the cyber security career?\n",
      "You're welcome! The answer to your question is...this will get you nowhere near where you need to be. I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and checking out the included roadmap.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  financially how much will the path you created cost and how much time, on average? I'm 50\n",
      "The answer really varies based on the individual but the path itself is to give you the skills and knowledge you need for a solid foundation, and is not necessarily just \"my version\" of a path. Realistically, most people break into Cybersecurity between 2-5 years of learning and gaining work experience through related jobs like IT. In a best case scenario and a very aggressive path, you might be as low as 9-12 months of studying/learning with no experience but the stars really have to align with you working through the roadmap quickly...it does happen though...this is covered in the eBook. You can look up salaries on websites like Glassdoor to see earning potential but entry-level Cybersecurity jobs (not IT or something related), typically have a range of $60-80k in the United States depending on your skills/knowledge, where the top end salaries in the career field are definitely in the multiple six figures (i.e., $200k+).\n",
      "Hello, I’m a civil engineer from venezuela that always liked the world of technology and cybernetics; now I have 2 years living in USA and want to have a cybersecurity certificate, my question is, do you think I can if I don’t have any studies about this field before? Is like I’m gonna start from zero\n",
      "Plenty of people get into the career field without prior knowledge or experience. I recommend following my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) for the best path.\n",
      "Thanks bro\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  hi Jon it’s me again, I hope you see my comment, I’m decided to start in the cybersecurity world, your videos and you ebook have really helped me, I just have a question, I’m worried because in indeed, I see almost every job that sets a requirement for entry level that says “bachelor’s degree in computer science or related field” so I’m worried because of how I’m gonna get my first job with the certifications but no degree in this area (I have a Venezuelan degree as a civil engineer but I don’t know if they see this as a related field ) what do you think? I strongly need a degree I computer science or something similar to get that first job?\n",
      " @juancorro9744  apply anyway, or you will always miss out on potential opportunities. Indeed, a degree can be beneficial, but it's only one part of the equation. Also, just because you see it listed in a job posting doesn't mean that it's a firm requirement.\n",
      "Hey, i am starting my career in cybersecurity, i started with the microsoft cybersecurity course and looking to take the microsoft sc-900 exam and go on with sc-300 & sc-100. My question is, is that a good path to land a job in cybersecurity?\n",
      "Also what do you think of the Microsoft course?\n",
      "It really depends on what kind of job that you want. I recommend starting with my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ), which includes a roadmap of skills and certifications that anybody trying to break into cybersecurity needs. From there, you can start to specialize in a specific area. Since you mentioned cloud, keep in mind that most cloud professionals are generalists and not specifically focused on security as their only task.\n",
      "Took it to prepare for the Security+. Good program, but I find the material a little too basic for me and know the Security+ is much more difficult and goes over many more topics than Google.\n",
      "Thanks for sharing! I feel like a lot of people aren't even finishing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate because there was a huge drop-off in discussion forum responses in the last couple of courses.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  It says \"Partcipation is optional\" I stopped participating after after the first prompt.\n",
      " @sahilsvision  If I remember correctly, it didn't say \"optional\" for all the posts, especially later in the program. I remember some of the topics weren't marked as complete unless I did it, but regardless, I expect a larger audience to continue commenting than what happened. I would love to see the official numbers.\n",
      "So what is the best online course to take in order to get a job in cyber security?\n",
      "I always recommend Cyber Training Pro ( https://www.cybertrainingpro.com/ ) but courses are just one part of the equation and won't get you there by themselves.\n",
      "While completion of each course we get a certificate right so do u have your name in it ? \n",
      "Beacuse i cant see mine. I've already completed three courses of it \n",
      "Plz reply\n",
      "Yes, each completion certificate will have your name on it. I'd make sure you have the correct name in your profile and if it still doesn't work, contact their support.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  instead of my name its showing courseera learner ...what does that mean ?\n",
      " @Jay_Ban  You probably didn't set your name. Did you contact their support? What did they say?\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  Thank you so much for your response ..its showing my name now after i verified it .\n",
      "Hi, whats your take on the Google IT Support cert and thank you\n",
      "I wouldn't really look at it unless I fell into an entry-level IT support position without doing anything whatsoever prior to the job. It doesn't really hold any value for employers but in the situation that I just mentioned, it will give you a relatively quick win to start ramping up. The second you get any other certification, you've flown past the target audience and most people at the same level of you are going to be past it anyways.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  thank you\n",
      "Do you have a video on the Google it support certification?\n",
      "I do not since it's not really part of my focus, which is cybersecurity.\n",
      "Fair review however you forgot the Google has the IT support certificate going over the windows OS and system admin and networking stuff\n",
      "The Google Cybersecurity Certificate is advertised as a starting from zero program that isn't related or dependent on another program...so I did not forget about it and reviewed the program as advertised.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  understood however I don't know why anyone would try to get into cybersec without having any idea about the file system, OS, active directory, basic networking principles, being a tech supper user etc\n",
      "\n",
      "I think they should recommend the IT support course first\n",
      "That might not seem like the logical or reasonable thing to do, but it happens...and companies like Google, continue to push that false narrative and underdeliver on promises. I'm not necessarily saying something like the support certificate makes sense or is good/bad but there is certain knowledge that's required to be successful and can't be overlooked.\n",
      "Sir what is.GRC.. and  can grc can help the entry level jobs .in INDIA\n",
      "I have several videos on GRC and training for it, but it stands for Governance, Risk, and Compliance. I also recommend beginning with my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "I am enrolled in a program from uso while serving in the Air Force, which program do you think is best? The google or ibm programs?\n",
      "Although I'm not familiar with that specific program, my recommendations are all provided in my free eBook's roadmap ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "So, what other online option besides Curseea would you recommend?\n",
      "I always recommend Cyber Training Pro ( https://www.cybertrainingpro.com/ ).\n",
      "I appreciate the honesty of this review and you not taking the sponsorship\n",
      "I'm glad that you enjoyed the content!\n",
      "Thanks for the info, I am presently a lab protection officer for the Department of energy and studying to get into the cyber security field I stopped the Google and started studying for the CompTIA Security+\n",
      "Thanks for sharing! I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and checking out the included roadmap. If you jump straight to the Security+, you're missing a lot of critical foundational knowledge that you'll have to step backwards to learn even if you're able to clear the Security+ without it.\n",
      "Absolutely thanks again, I wish I had found you prior to purchasing prof messer’s program!\n",
      "The good news is that I do a lot of things in Cybersecurity so whether you want YouTube videos, LinkedIn content, training or career services...I've got something for everybody!\n",
      "This is a very well thought review do you review other Google certificates\n",
      "I'm glad that you enjoyed it! This is the only one that I've done as of today.\n",
      "The weak part of these coursera courses is the testing. Passing the exams is absolutely trivial and most of the more elaborate assignments don't amount to much in terms of challenge either. The cert of completion proves little more than that you took the time to sit through it. Hence why its paramount to get true certification like security+ afterwards and prove you can pass a properly proctored exam.\n",
      "You are correct in that certificates of completion, such as the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, don't hold much value for many reasons, including that nothing is proctored. Still, other glaring issues exist, as stated in this video.\n",
      "Well, this puts a damper on this. I'm on module five. For what's its worth, I hope this will at least be me somewhat prepared for the Security+\n",
      "Sorry to deliver the bad news but you will absolutely have to do additional preparation for not just the Security+ but also your foundational knowledge to become a proficient professional.\n",
      "Hi Jon, hope to find you well. First I am Grateful that you made this channel. It is very confusing the roadmap for a entry level cybersecurity analist. A lot of confusing information. I realize one thingh most of the certifications have a lack of hands on and labs, really pratical cybersecurity. I just finished the Google IT support studying Comptia A+ and Network + as a foundation of IT. I do not want to be a importer in my future Cybersecurity career. I am planning as my roadmap to do the Google Cybersecurity and also the Microsoft Cybersecurity analyst, and, at the same time use the Security + as a self study (again everything in Comptia is very theorical no hands on labs) to create the foundations. After this goals do the Cybersecurity roadmap in Try Hack Me and in StationX, very pratical. What is your advice? Thank you for your attention. Best Regards, Ricardo.\n",
      "I can't control a bunch of the trash information out there, but I recommend following the roadmap in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ). Hands-on experience is helpful, but there is more to being successful in this career field than just hands-on experience. If you do what my roadmap says, you'll be in a good position. Platforms like Try Hack Me are a good way to supplement what you're learning, but they are by no means a replacement option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding your comment about the Security+, I highly recommend reviewing the exam objectives because several tools are included. That means if you aren't getting hands-on experience with those certifications or tools, that's a result of either a failure of the training provider you're using and/or you are ignoring the exam objectives.\n",
      "If a course is not helping you land a job, it's not worth it. Simple as that. I got the Google because I heard it was great and cheap but despite getting it, I can't find a job to save my life lol. I have other certs too (like A+ and Qualys) but even with those the Google Cybersecurity Cert doesn't seem to be helping me at all and you NEVER see it on job listings... ever... literally not one time and trust me, I've checked lol.\n",
      "Searching on job websites like Indeed is one of the fastest ways to validate if employers value a specific certification and if it's worth pursuing. Although certifications can play an important role in landing a job, they are just one factor of many to becoming a competitive candidate. Although I have a ton of content published on YouTube and other platforms, I always recommend that people check out the Career Services on Cyber Training Pro ( https://www.cybertrainingpro.com/ ) because we can create a strategy tailored to your situation on how to land a job including dramatically improving your resume.\n",
      "Cyber security graduate here, I won't be wasting my time with it that's for sure.\n",
      "Thanks for sharing and for watching the video!\n",
      "Do we get a certificate for each course or do we only get one certificate for all the 8 at the end?\n",
      "Yes, they give you a completion certificate for each course and then a final one at the end.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  oh thank you!\n",
      "I haven’t finished the video yet so if you address it I’m sorry for asking but is there anything you would suggest to try out for cyber security or even just IT in general for someone with no experience and wants to change careers\n",
      "Anything that you can do to develop a deeper interest. This can include podcasts, YouTube videos, search on Google for Cybersecurity projects, or possibly look at Try Hack Me. It's going to be difficult without a stronger background to dive very deep, so \"trying things out\" is going to be fairly limited without overwhelming you. I also recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ), which includes a roadmap to help you be successful.\n",
      "Hlo sir thank you for your honest opinion , but it would be a great help if you can tell some better alternatives to this course if this is not that good , i mean which will be more in depth about cyber security for beginners .. pleasee  help\n",
      "I'm glad that you enjoyed the content! As I always tell people, make sure to check the description because there are always additional resources related to the content. You can find the roadmap that I recommend included in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  thank you so much !!\n",
      "6:33 - 6:46 Wait what?? It takes 6 months to complete if we study 7 hours a day? But you completed everything in 4 days?? This puzzles me.\n",
      "Minor mix up in words...you can easily calculate the actual required time by visiting the certificate page and doing the math based on how much time you can spend studying.\n",
      "It seemed more blue team oriented. Love the review it was on point. As someone taking the course I see SQL is uncessary\n",
      "I wouldn't say that SQL is completely unnecessary but certainly where they emphasize isn't aligned with their target audience.\n",
      "I love your hand engagement! And I'm glad you told me about  how they don't teach you anything about kali linux! I'm really interested in kali linux, and need a course to teach me that!  Thank You!\n",
      "Glad it was helpful!\n",
      "So my question to you is what would you recommend?\n",
      "All of my recommendations can be found in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "I am looking at the ebook you mention and in resources for example security+ I see that there are books to buy on Amazon and a website where they offer you for a price to train you. I don't see anything practical, I see a lot of theory, am I wrong?\n",
      "I'm not sure which resource you are specifically talking about but all of them include a variety of training. Additionally, you shouldn't solely being relying on a source to give you hands on experience as experimentation of what you are learning will teach you a lot more than a staged environment, which is not real world.\n",
      "your thoughs on Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate\n",
      "From a job market standpoint, you still have a similar issue where employers aren't asking for the certification. Looking at the content itself, it appears to be built to give you some immediate skills but you're not going to have broad knowledge of security as it's highly focused on building those specific skills.\n",
      "If I pass the eight parts, do I get a certificate or is there a test?\n",
      "Through the webcam, knowing that I am weak in the English language, I passed the first part certificate with a grade of 92%؟\n",
      "There is no \"final exam\" that covers everything for this program. You complete all the courses and get the certificate of completion.\n",
      "I am new to IT sector.  I have zero knowledge whatsoever but can I take this course and land a job based on cybersecurity.\n",
      "This course alone is not sufficient to land a job in a field like cybersecurity that has a lot of demand and hungry professionals. I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) where I've provided a roadmap of skills and certifications to set you up for success.\n",
      "Ok - now what do you recommend?\n",
      "You can find all my recommendations in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "then what entry level cyber security certs you suggest?\n",
      "I have it all documented in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "as a beginner where should  i start cyber security\n",
      "Start with my Getting Started page ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ), which will walk you through beginning your journey!\n",
      "Thank you Jon! This was great & informative! I think I need to find another way to break into Cybersecurity from Software Engineering, without this Google Cybersecurity Certificate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Google at this point, thinks it can sell ANYTHING! They're trying to onboard more sheep.\n",
      "I can't agree with you more, especially for Python discussions. The course stressed the importance of Python - probably because Google wants to hire people with Python skills. I know this is sponsored by Google, it doesn't talk anything about Microsoft or Apple environments. The course was good recap for me to review the knowledge, but definitely not a universal recommendation for the people who has not yet worked in cybersecurity in the past.\n",
      "Thanks for sharing and I'm glad that you enjoyed the video!\n",
      "Are people getting jobs with these courses though? That's my worry. I wanna begin, but if someone's gonna tell me I need a degree and close the door on me, then what's the point \n",
      "The very few cases for Google that I've heard about have been very entry level support jobs. If you follow my advice you can easily get a much better job and have more skills.\n",
      "Is it ok to take this course just for a label to put in my resume and then gather more info through other sources?\n",
      "Taking this program isn't going to hurt your resume, it's just not the most efficient or effective path to take. I always recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) where I provide a roadmap of skills and certifications to pursue.\n",
      "Four months to completed so $200 wasted no one is hiring right after this program. Although it is a good foundation you have to continue to do the leg work to build a portfolio and network.\n",
      "It's certainly one thing if a program is requested by employers and requires some additional work. Unfortunately, nobody is asking for this program so progressing through it is just burning time and then you have to do a bunch of work after the fact still.\n",
      "I really appreciate your honest review of this Course for, I'm using it to prepare myself for SECPlus which I think is worth it also we shouldn't expect them to Cover it All.\n",
      "Glad it was helpful! No certification will \"cover it all\" but the Security+ isn't an overwhelming level of knowledge...people new to the industry pass it all the time...so it isn't really necessary to make a very stripped down version.\n",
      "Im a beginner on this, and i want to start a career in CyberSecurity, just finished this Google CyberSecurity cert, if someone can  help me to guide what i need to do next,? What i should do?? Ill appreciate it\n",
      "All of my recommendations including a roadmap to success can be found in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "I think people should note that Google gives certificates when completed and CompTIA gives certifications. Google doesn't have proctors to complete and CompTIA does. That should tell you the value alone\n",
      "At the end of the day, the true value of certifications is based on employer demand because the ultimate objective of them is to help you get a job. After that determination, we can certainly further assess if certifications live up to their promises, deliver quality content, etc. like I have done in this video, but those are still secondary to employer demand.\n",
      "What courses or programs do you suggest for getting training in CyberSecurity?\n",
      "I always recommend beginning with my Getting Started page ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) as that has the resources to begin your journey. I also recommend Cyber Training Pro ( https://www.cybertrainingpro.com/ ) as a training and career services provider.\n",
      "Thank you so much for speaking the truth and saving us time and money. Blessings from Cyprus. \n",
      "You're welcome and thank you for watching!\n",
      "Anything on Coursera that you think is better?\n",
      "You should treat Coursera knowledge as a personal gain but in the job market and industry, it holds very little weight/value as a training program or credential.\n",
      "Thank you for sharing. I'm changing careers and I'm  interested in tech, just don't know where to start.\n",
      "The best place to start is by grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and working through the provided information.\n",
      "Hi I want to change my career and I’m interested in cybersecurity but I don’t know where to start. I would like any advice on what school or online classes I can take to start in the right direction. Thank you\n",
      "Great question! I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) where I've already documented that information along with a lot of other valuable details to set you up for success.\n",
      "Theres the Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst and the IBM Cybersecurity Analyst in Coursera but I think Security + certification is seen more like an industry standard for business to hire someone\n",
      " \"just my opinion please don't hang me\".\n",
      "It's relatively easy to search on job boards for specific certifications to see what's in demand and then prioritize your learning. Why gamble with certifications that never show up in job postings when it's fairly unlikely that employers will value them?\n",
      "What course do you recommend to get started then ?\n",
      "You can find all my recommendations on my website: https://jongood.com/getstarted/\n",
      "Thanks  @JonGoodCyber  \n",
      "It's pretty refreshing to see an actual honest review (and not one that just starts off with a misleading premise then pushes you to an affiliate link). It's also pretty impressive that you actually took the course. I've been considering trying to get into this field, but after doing some research it seems the prevailing opinion is that this course really isn't going to give you a leg up unless you are already working in IT (helpdesk at least) and you aren't likely to be able to leverage the certificate to get even an entry level cybersecurity job. Thanks for putting in the work and insight to actually add value and not just manipulate traffic.\n",
      "Thank you for the kind words! I'll always speak the truth unlike some people. I recommend grabbing my eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) because that is already packaged with a ton of answers for your journey and a roadmap.\n",
      " @GensUnaSumus09  The advice that I give is backed by both facts and statistics. If you don't believe it, you are more than welcome to go on a job board and search for yourself to find the exact same conclusions. The reality is that I help people break into the industry and fast-track their careers every single day. Also, to imply that my FREE eBook is some scam is ridiculous and very troll-like. I hope you have a better day.\n",
      "Agreed, not that good as they say! In the certificate, they mentions that the identity of the certificate owner is not verified! How horrible!\n",
      "Thanks for watching and I'm glad that you enjoyed it!\n",
      "i thought that the google cert is just a prep for comptia security+\n",
      "Not really as it barely scratches the surface on the exam objectives.\n",
      "Only reason Im doing the Google cert is because my public library got me a free coursera account.  Figured might as well.\n",
      "I always take my time into consideration, which is not \"free,\" but as long as you understand the pros and cons then I won't argue with your situation.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  good point\n",
      "Really ?\n",

      "This has already been commented, but yes sometimes when giving a lot of information, it's possible that a minor mistake in word happens...not that big of a deal. It's very easy for somebody to see how many hours they say the course is and do the simple math calculation.\n",
      "Any recommendations to good alternatives?\n",
      "You can find the roadmap that I recommend in my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "The Google cert is better than security +  from a learning and experience standpoint….IF you actually execute cybersecurity tasks in as a part of your portfolio.\n",
      "It's a huge mistake if you think either one will prepare you for the career field by itself. Another common mistake that people make, which also addresses your comment, is regarding the delivery of the information. Google (via Coursera) is the single place where the Google Cybersecurity Certificate is offered, where the CompTIA Security+ exam is delivered by CompTIA (via exam partners), but the training can be offered by anybody. I've seen more than enough Security+ training (CompTIA, Cyber Training Pro, study guide books, etc.) that includes practical hands-on exercises for students to complete...so if you are in a program that provides these exercises and aren't doing them, that's your failure as a student, not the training provider or certification vendor.\n",
      "So what is a good alternative to Google Certificates for training to get an entry level Cyber Security job?\n",

      "Jon as a beginner I was waiting in your conclusion to hear some best cyber security foundational courses in comparison to Google unfortunately didn’t happen .\n",
      "That is a much larger discussion than can fit into a relatively short video. I recommend grabbing my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) and checking out all the content I have already covering that subject.\n",
      "Wait, What??? You completed the entire program in 4 days.....I need notes please......\n",
      "Sharing notes wouldn't do anything to help you actually learn the material. Also, I'm not new to the industry so I wasn't \"learning\" the material, but if you are new to the industry, it's likely going to take you quite a bit longer to complete the program.\n",
      "There’s no way! \n",
      "I applied for this course but charge of 1488 shows on the Coursera page… This is not free of cost training programme\n",

      "\n",
      "Per the FAQ on Coursera:\n",
      "\"In the U.S. and Canada, Coursera charges $49 per month after the initial 7-day free trial period. The Google Cybersecurity Certificate can be completed in less than 6 months at under 10 hours per week of part-time study, so most learners can complete the certificate for less than $300 USD. In other countries where Google Career Certificates are available, your cost may be lower.\"\n",
      "Just signed up for this course and then watched this video. It may or may not be good but as a beginner like myself I hope it's enough to get my feet wet. I want to be an ethical hacker someday and one of the certifications I would need Comp TIA Security +. If google is going to give me 30% off of that cert then I'll take it lol. Just hate the idiots that try to make it seem like its all that though. So money hungry nowadays.\n",
      "Regardless of the choice that you make, you're now more informed on proper expectations of the program.\n",

      "From a job market standpoint, you still have a similar issue where employers aren't asking for the certification.

      " @JonGoodCyber  thanks for the answer!\n",
      "It seems like you are downplaying the Google cert in favor of your own training. Do you offer certification?\n",
      "Hardly...this review has nothing to do with my training or I would have compared it directly. That said, I train people on the skills and certifications that are in-demand by employers, and offer career services to help people accelerate their progression. I am not a certification vendor nor do I work for one, but if the Google certificate was as great as the sponsored content claims, I could have just as easily made a course on it, but that's not the case.\n",

      "Googles cybersecurity certificate is not a DoD 8570 exam\n",
      "I never said it is, but yes you are correct that it’s not on the list. Also, 8570 isn’t the current standard for the DoD.\n",
      "What is the current standard?\n",

      " @JonGoodCyber  it’s still qualified. CompTIA currently has approval for 8 of their certificates across 31 work roles under DoDM 8140.03 which includes Sec+\n",
      " @Linux333  This is the first time you've mentioned the Security+ in your comments for this thread. Additionally, I never said it wasn't on the former and current standards.\n",
      "Please do comptia usually offer discounts for their certification?\n",
      "I don't recall ever seeing CompTIA offer discounts on certifications unless they are in beta. That doesn't mean it hasn't happened in the past or won't happen in the future but I wouldn't count on it.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  Okay,I appreciate the reply.\n",
      "I will be saving for it\n",
      "I think it’s most valuable as an intro to cybersecurity. It’s not worth much (if anything) on its own, but it helps build immersion and is a decent first step towards Sec+.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you have Sec+ though, it’s not worth worrying about unless you’re specifically targeting a job directly at Google, and even then there’s probably better things to make you a stronger candidate that you should spend your time/money on.\n",
      "Certainly, if somebody just wants to hear a little bit about Cybersecurity they could go through the program but it falls nowhere near the best path for the reasons mentioned in this video and others that weren't even worth mentioning. There's no way that Google would consider you qualified to work for them just by having this certification...it doesn't come anywhere near making somebody professionally proficient in help desk, IT, or Cybersecurity.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  oh yeah, I didn’t mean to say that this in and of itself would get someone a job at google lol. I just think it helps to make applicants slightly more competitive if they can put a vendor’s cert or three on their resume when applying for a job at that vendor.\n",
      "No worries! That benefit really only matters when it has to do with the vendor's actual technology. For example, companies like Cisco and AWS absolutely want you to have their certifications to show you understand their technologies. Still, they usually don't value the lowest option available for their employees...that's why you tend to see a lot of CCIEs working at Cisco.\n",

      "Or was the \"Easter egg\" an honest mistake?\n",
      " @itsevan1375 , lol. It wasn't an Easter Egg (although my videos occasionally have them). Still, I get many comments about it despite it saying the correct time on the webpage and having minimal impact on the content. It's more fun than saying, \"Yes, I know.\"\n",
      "I took it as a beginner. I'm not confident enough to go out and get a job. I did learn alot though.\n",
      "The fact that you're learning is the most important thing. My goal is really to make sure that people have the proper expectations if they decide to enroll in the program because there's a lot of hype out there without addressing reality.\n",
      "I really liked the Google Cybersecurity Certification, however, I do just see it as an entry level overview. It does not prepare you for a Cybersecurity job. It is however a good overview of cybersecurity concepts and will help weed-out people who think they are interested, but don't really know about cybersecurity.\n",
      "Weeding out beginners is not really the best course of action when we need a ton of people to fill jobs. Beginners need continued inspiration and then over time, people will figure out if the industry is really a good fit once they are actually doing the job for a little bit.\n",
      "I want to move to security to get away from the dying desktop role.  Microsoft even changed it from desktop to endpoint.  The role of desktop is going away and becoming none technical.  I don't want to be left out of the change I see happening in the next 5-10 years.\n",
      "I don't honestly think that the desktop role is going away entirely because people will always need some level of support, but like all jobs, things will change over time. Also, I don't think people generally desire to stay in desktop support their entire career as it can be quite grueling in comparison with some of the other jobs that exist.

I’m tired of seeing YouTube videos where people truly only gloss over the topics themselves then make videos about why you should do something when they know very little themselves.  I was wondering if I wanted to go ahead and do the certification but was not sure based on my experience with the Google IT support Cert. when I took that certification, I didn’t feel like I had a great foundational understanding. I felt like I got way more from the A+ certification that I am preparing to take next month. I completed the first class of this cyber cert and it was OK. As far as knowledge I will just use a couple other classes as supplemental material like python and SQL  while I’m in school.\n",
      "Thanks Jon,\n",
      "In all honesty, I didn't need to go through the certification to give a review because I have a lot of experience in the industry and with certifications so I saw the writing on the wall before it even started.

      "It's not that you'll learn topics that have absolutely not value, but you are going to learn topics that will be reintroduced again later so you might not have to spend as long on some of them the second time around. Also, if you're in school and not working, you have more time available versus somebody who's trying to make an immediate or quick jump to the career field.\n",

My free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) provides a clear roadmap of skills and certifications that ultimately are what will be expected in this career field. Don't mistake that for the information somehow will \"harm you\" but there's good paths and bad paths...if you want to use your time and resources effectively and efficiently...and the Google certificate isn't on the good path.\n",

      "get an associates agree. talked with a professor today a simple 1 year certificate isn't enough.\n",
      "its...aight. it feels good to get the cert, it gives you a board overview of security principles. career circle is absolute shit. the labs are awful. both THM and HTB have free linux modules that are so much better, and network chuck has waaaaay better python education. I dont even remember a single thing about AD which i think is weird. Overall, it is only worth burning through as fast as the can to get the SEC+ discount at the end.....which is another cert i feel like was a waste of time.\n",
      "That's because there wasn't anything about AD and they barely even mentioned the existence of Windows.\n",

      "I recommend visiting my Getting Started page ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) to understand the knowledge that will be required. Remember that most information you'll need is available on the internet in some way, but it will certainly take more time. When you pay for training, you are paying not only for the expertise of the instructor(s) but also the effort it takes to aggregate the data for you. Also, remember that the higher you go in positions, the more difficult it's going to be to get by on free resources, which is why getting into an organization where, if necessary, you'll have the funds to help support your learning...or better, they will help you out!\n",

      "A hater? This is an unbiased review so if the program had no issues, I have no reason to say otherwise...but that's not the case. Just because you took other courses that were even worse, doesn't automatically give credibility to this course. All of my recommendations can be found in my eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ).\n",
      "Q: So, Do I cancel my subscription? It's the only thing I can afford\n",
      "Only you can make that choice based on the information you have, but if something isn't going to get you the results you are seeking, does it make sense to do it?

      "I have a lot of content discussing college on YouTube and in my free eBook on my website ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ), but the short answer is you don't \"need\" it, but it can certainly help make you a better candidate overall. Remember, college/degrees are only one piece of the puzzle that can help make you more attractive to employers.\n",

      "I’m glad that you enjoyed the content!\n",
      "Did the cert and imo it was a complete waste of time. Even if you have never worked with computers, the cert is designed so poorly that you could pass with little effort. It does not test any knowledge; it really only tests your test taking ability. For multiple choice questions, if you get them wrong you can retake the test on each section 3x per DAY. Process of elimination will get you to a passing grade even if you're completely lost. The labs often have the answers to earlier problems contained in later problems. A good 30% of the content is on the trust system. Here is an assignment......click 'Done' if you completed it. Ok. Done. A bunch of YT folks recommend the cert and now I have to question the value of their opinions.\n",
      "I discussed these in the video, but this certificate has many issues. If the value was higher in the job market, that could allow me to overlook some of this stuff, but it doesn't, so it's really just a poorly done certificate. I tell it like it is, and I certainly can't entirely agree with basically all of the content on this certificate (besides this review) that is full of sponsor bias.\n",
      "Hey did any 1 complete the program and get any offers?\n",
      "I haven't heard of any significant job offers coming from the program and the very few cases that I have heard of, have all been very entry level support jobs...nothing in Cyber. Maybe there's somebody out there that was fortunate enough though.\n",

Most of the comments on this video debating some of the facts are from those with limited to no experience and don't have the same professional insight into what matters as me, who has been in the industry for quite some time. I will continue giving the most effective and efficient path advice possible, and if people choose not to follow it, they have to live with the consequences of their decisions. The results speak for themselves as I regularly help people of all experience levels to accelerate their careers faster than they thought was possible.\n",
      "Sooo… is it worth it? Is it enough to get a job?\n",
      "I recommend watching or rewatching the video because I've broken down my thoughts in this video. No certification will guarantee you a job by itself as certifications themselves are only one piece of the puzzle to making you a competitive/qualified candidate. I recommend checking out my free eBook ( https://jongood.com/getstarted/ ) where I've provided a roadmap to follow based on what is expected by employers and the career field to be successful.\n",
      "Bottom line is: you won’t get a job by just completing this course, but… it’s a great introductory material, so I wouldn’t entirely rubbish it.\n",
      "I think my review is fair based on the program as it sits. That said, my advice always takes into account the most effective and efficient path, and this is no different.\n",

      "I completed the course to review it for people as a seasoned professional with knowledge of what's actually required in the career field, not to \"learn\" the information as I already know the information. You might be new to the channel but I already have well over a decade of experience in Cybersecurity and many high-level certifications including the CISSP, CISA, CISM among many others. Somebody just starting their journey wouldn't have been able to learn much in a week but again this was expedited because of the situation and objective. The content is also not sponsored so I don't benefit either way...hardly a money grab if that was targeted at me.\n",
      " @JonGoodCyber  my point is,  how does this benefit a hiring company, if someone isn't held to any standard at all?  I could probably Google all these answers and get a certificate.  There's no real accountability.  And if I mess up, I can just keep trying until I \"pass\".  \n",

      "Don’t normally comment but I started watching your videos back in October of 2021. After watching your videos and doing the Google Analytics Certificate I am starting my first tech job as a Jr Data Analyst! So thank you for all your videos and information, it definitely helped me on my career change.\n",
      "That's so awesome! Congrats!!\n",
      "Hey Kyle! Glad things are working out for you! Can you share what you did during/after the Google Certification in order to land the job? Did you have previous related-experience in tech too?\n",
      " @AlexTheAnalyst  How difficult would it be to become a data analyst without a college degree? You probably get this question often so I apologize lol\n",
      "I started taking the first two courses a few months ago after taking the Google Analytics certification, because I am working in marketing. I found them content to be pretty basic as well, very introductory, I stopped the course and started studying for the Marketing science meta certification by myself (I already have knowledge in statistics, Python and data modeling) by watching the blueprint videos and lectures. I passed at my first attempt, and I can say the most important thing is to understand the basics of Facebook products for data analysis, hypothesis, interpretation of MMM models, conversion and brand lifts.\n",
      "I really loved the course 3 of this certificate, I absolutely didn't feel any inconvenience about a bit dark background of the instructor, his manner of presenting the material was quite good and the content itself seemed great to me. This course sparked my interest for statistics and motivated me to take an in-depth statistics course. Actually, Google Analytics certificate is missing statistics completely (I'm right now in the last course of it) and in my opinion it is hard to do a thorough and in-depth  analysis of data without the knowledge of statistics. So I would really recommend course 3 to those who have completed Google analytics certificate.\n",
      "Thanks for reviewing this, I have just finished some parts of the Google analytics course so I'm trying to find what to do next. I think the Google course is a little bit basic if you have analytics experience already, although I did learn things from the course that will help make me a more well rounded data analyst.  Great content as always \n",
      "Hey, I'm that \"character\" from the 2nd course!  Only watch 7:20 to 9:35 (especially @8:50), the part where it's about me & my part! \n",
      "\n",
      "But more seriously, a buddy of mine follows you and I just so happened to check you out via them where I saw this review of the Meta course I helped build! I won't comment too much about the course & your review but I will say I think it's fair coming from a data analyst and there's always room for improvement for the team.\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually work full-time as a data scientist / machine learning engineer but I teach & help develop technical courses on the side. But I usually go the \"off-camera\" route or do live recordings (I used to be a data science instructor / curriculum developer at a boot camp, Flatiron School, where I would do live lectures). Frankly, it's nice to hear your relatively positive comments on the part I helped build and lead!\n",
      "\n",
      "I personally try to constantly improve (maybe my \"stage presence\" could be better ) but I won't lie and say that it didn't make me feel proud that you generally liked my section  I could easily see creating a whole course from just a couple weeks of the Python section, but of course there are real world restrictions & limitations that come into play in building a full course like this. And I am obviously biased towards my section since it's what most closely what I do in my day-to-day lol\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, thanks for sharing your opinions in this review! I know everyone on the team & I are always looking to improve! I've been wanting to go back and make more explanation YouTube videos on data science, machine learning, and software development so this has personally been helpful!\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't ask for a more honest and independent review from a data analyst! Keep it up!\n",
      "Haha your presentation was my favorite out of all of them! Happy to hear my review was fair :D\n",
      "This was super informative! I graduated college about a year ago with double majors in business analytics and marketing and have been thinking about getting into more marketing analytics type work after working with more general data (and some heavy/advanced financial/accounting data - not my cup of tea) at my current job. I have the data background and general marketing knowledge, but not much experience in specific marketing analytics techniques - that part of this course may be interesting!\n",
      "Thanks for the review Alex!\n",
      "\n",

But I am unable to figure out how to do. Can you please make a video or series to demonstrate how actual data analysis projects work in real world organization. Thank you\n",

      "This is my first comment on here… I hope you see it… What do you think of creating a Discord server for your Data Analyst community maybe potentially help some of your community members build a type of connection in the data world? I know it won’t be easy with your schedule and all but please think about it️\n",

      "Do I need to know about coding to learn this course? I mean what if I have no knowledge right off the bat?\n",
      "Thank you for the review Alex. But I wouldn’t touch anything that comes out of Meta. Their massive corruption and lack of ethics really disvalue the reputation of their “certified exams” and may even hurt your resume. There is a reason why they ditched their Facebook name. Besides, it is better to go for more technical certs offered by actual colleges, better experience and knowledge.\n",
      "I don't disagree with that\n",
      "What technical certs offered by colleges do you recommend that are similar to this & Google Analaytics?\n",
      "Thank you for your comment. I was initially considering taking that certificate until I found out it is issued by Meta Platforms. Your input has helped me make my decision. I will continue to search for other marketing analytics certificates.\n",

      "I am close to finish the Google Data Analytics professional course, so what's your recommend for this course? Do I need to do this or not necessary?\n",

      "Thanks for keeping it real!\n",
      "I always will!\n",
      "A Facebook data center is 5 miles from where I live, I think this would be nice if it helped people to get hired.\n",

      "I'm not done yet - haven't failed it so I'm still going lol\n",
      " @AlexTheAnalyst  Great. Good luck with that. \n",

      "Alex, i did all and passed first five courses. The last one I did not do as the course was NOT launched yet and not worth paying USD49 for continue.\n",

      "I liked you comment about the man at the basement \n",
      "But it's true though :D\n",
      "I took his course and I share the same sentiment about the course being a bit boring and the support for the data analytics course was poor after running into a grading issue\n",
      "Glad I wasn't the only one! haha\n",
      "Sir now I am pursuing integrated mtech 5 years course specialization in data science now I completed 3rd can you please say how to and how much I need to prepare to get decent job as fresher in data science sector because there are vast number of topics I am very confused like upto how many concepts I need to cover as a fresher to get decent job in data science sector\n",
      "I agree. It looks pretty basic. As someone learning Python, I wouldn't go for it. \n",
      "Also Alex, you can always increase the playspeed of the videos. Saves times.\n",
      "Finally, I hope those Meta lectures don't come after you for your honesty \n",
      "Haha they'll never stop me...\n",
      "how long does it takes to do this course? and can you do it in a short amount of time? meaning, if it takes like 3 months, can you do it in a few days instead?\n",
      "Hey Alex, Thanks for the info as always. \n",
      "Being from such a large and well-known company I wonder if they will update the course or keep it more META specific.\n",
      "Boy all that negativity and you gave it a 6?  Based on your underwhelmed analysis, you should have given it a 3 or 4.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for your review of this course!\n",
      "There's still a lot of good material in there and it wasn't all bad - definitely not perfect though so I think a 6 is fairly accurate from my perspective.\n",
      "The doppelgänger comment !\n",
      "Can u plz review my assignments\n",

      "the Maths for Machine Learning specialisation was one of the first that i've ever done on Coursera. and it's still my favourite set of courses i've done on Coursera so far.\n",
      "Thank you for this recommendation, Giles. I just completed the entire course. tl;dr: I'm glad I did it, it's a great course overall and I would recommend people take it, bu unlike you, the reason I also found the PCA course (i.e. the third and last part) the weakest isn't because the teacher wasn't as personable as the previous two. For those interested, read below for my full impressions of that part:\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't really mind the fact that the third teacher doesn't really connect with the viewer. Yes, they don't smile much and they don't have the same kind of energy as the first two teachers, but as long as the pedagogy is there, it's all good... But that's the issue really: the teacher and the content make too many assumptions about the students, and the pedagogy felt lacking as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if the course is labeled \"intermediate\", it's supposed to be the logical progression of courses 1 and 2, and it feels like anything but that. Mathematical concepts, formulas and notation are often glossed over in a sentence, with few visual or concrete examples, such that you're very quickly overwhelmed if your math knowledge isn't already way beyond what was expected in the other two courses. When you're not already really comfortable with (from my point of view) fairly advanced maths, too much abstraction can be very intimidating and a complete motivation killer. You just end up feeling like you're an idiot or like mathematics just aren't for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The course content is lighter (4 weeks only), yet at the same time, it covers far more complex topics, and it often feels like much less effort was put into it. For example, the teacher often defaults to giving you reading material - some of which is quite heavy on esoteric notation that is barely covered, if at all - instead of making explanatory videos. Another example: the feedback on quiz questions, most of the time, amounts to \"Great job!\" or \"Incorrect\", with no explanations. The quizzes themselves often feel completely disconnected from the lessons that precede or follow them. They can be extremely easy, or extremely hard, usually with no in-between. And the programming assignments can be strangely worded or contain mistakes at times, which can throw you off as a student. They certainly threw me off, even though I'm already quite familiar with Python and numpy. In other words, the substance of the assignments wasn't necessarily insurmountable - I was shocked how quickly I completed some of them, in fact -, but the way they're framed and explained made some of them more puzzling than they needed to be sometimes. All those aspects are big departures from the teaching style of the previous courses. Lastly, though this was also an issue with the other courses, the teachers and staff barely ever reply to questions on the forum. Not too much of an issue when the course itself is great, but for this third course, it didn't help matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize I sound very critical, but again, this isn't to say people shouldn't take the course. They should take it, including the third part, if they have any interest in machine/deep learning and they need to brush up on maths. It's easily worth the €40/month - by the way, you can go through the entire curriculum in a month if you can devote 4-6 hours to it almost every day like I inexplicably managed to do. I just wanted to push back a little against what you said in the video, where you seemed to imply that people were unfairly complaining about some of the assignments. From someone who isn't already very comfortable with maths and abstractions but was diligently making their way through all the content regardless, let me emphasize: it's not just that the third course will challenge you and you should just deal with it; it's that it could stand to be improved, or at least give more pointers to helpful external resources (not just a link to a Wikipedia article). Being challenging or intermediate level isn't an excuse for an unbalanced difficulty curve or hasty coverage of complex topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will say this though: that last quiz before the final assignment forced me to do a deep dive on partial derivatives (especially the chain rule) and gave my poor little brain quite a workout. Genuinely thankful for that. And again, the previous two courses alone are worth enrolling for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking forward to more course/book recommendations! :)\n",
      "for the third course it would be very good if they include the statistics and probability instead of PCA\n",
      "I am still in the second course, and you wouldn't believe me when If I told you that I already finished my Deep Learning specialization, but chose to study this specialization to gain more depth in the related math, and still I am impressed so far by the first 2 courses.\n",
      "This course was really helpful!. It saved me in my first Master's degree semester.\n",
      "oh, I've been waiting for this review ever since you announced you were going to do it weeks ago -- YEA !  \n",
      "so happy to hear what you've got to say\n",
      "excellent review, I would add that using/learning sympy in parallel helped me a lot following the course and understanding the mathematical concepts\n",
      "i had started the course but couldn't find time due to work i would definitely pursue it, now that you recommend it\n",
      "I am was not strong, when it came to maths at school but in in my \"post-high school\" education, I worked really hard and exceeded expectations. So much so, that my parents asked if I had cheated or paid someone to write my exams, lol...but this gave me the belief to overcome these fears I had, related to these \"high school\" shortcomings and changed my perception that DS, ML and AI were realms for other people, not me..... I have become really interested in these fields, ML and AI in particular. I am a long way from reaching my goals but your channel and  recommendation are useful, awesome, insightful and inspiring. PS: His new courses starts today and I just watched this vid! 5th July 2021 - Thank You so much.\n",
      "Thank you! I've wanted to do this specialization along with a Deep Learning specialization. I am more confident to proceed now :)\n",
      "thank you for your reviews. really I was confused about this course\n",
      "That's what i looking for some time ago. Thanks so much for the info Giles.\n",
      "Can you please say how it relates to the Mathematics for Machine Learning book, do you think the book is more comprehensive?\n",
      "PCA is more complicated than computing eigenvectors or multivariable calculus. Although PCA is part of multivariable calculus.\n",
      "first thing after I started watching\n",
      "0:05 the amount of open tabs\n",
      "About to do that one, thanks for inside review\n",
      "Worth it! thankyou will check em out.\n",
      "This guy is into programming but has old school British mathematician vibes\n",
      "I am wondering why did they not include any course on probability and statistics in this specialization. I took these courses during my bachelor's in engineering but looking for a resource to revise the subjects. Is there any other specialization that includes a course on probability and statistics that you recommend?\n",
      "I'm doing the first course and its the best math course I have ever seen. What a teacher!!\n",
      "What's your thought on Khan Academy? I haven't done math since I was in high school(2009) and I'm revising it from the ground up. I started with pre-algebra, on Algebra 1 now. Why am I doing this?  I'm interested in Data science.\n",
      "Yes there are some challanging labs and programming assignment....but after clear understanding of concept I found easy to solve and the tip is if you exhausted dont do it.......do  it with fresh mind.\n",
      "I am scanning through skills required for ML, very helpful indeed, at least I know I will be able to do maths ;)\n",
      "I'm currently planning on taking the IBM AI enginerring course and am considering taking the Imperial College course in order to get my maths up to speed. Maths is far, far, far from my strong subject; I somehow managed to get an o'level and then avoided it until doing an Open University course on maths for science, in which I learnt more than I had in my school years. So... Am I likely to struggle with this course ? Is it a good foundation for ongoing ML & AI study ? Any snesible replies will be welcome. Thanks.\n",
      "Actually I completed the first course of this specialization and having completed this far Idk why are people commenting that the assignments are hard. In fact those were totally based on lectures. After all this is the price you need to pay to learn something new and earn a certificate from a renowned institution. Otherwise just fast forwarding the lectures and solving just the petty assignment doesn't add any worth to your learning. Rather it is the best course for anyone who wants to equip themselves with the mathematical knowledge needed for machine learning.\n",
      "I love mathematics… I wish I were younger so I could become mathematician. Now I just work every day and come home ….\n",
      "Maybe you can find a way to do it.\n",
      "Maybe. Just maybe.\n",
      "I'm here early today I just wanna ask I'm completely new to python where do I start thank you very much in advance\n",
      "Great videos. plaining to take this in the near future.  Cheer!\n",
      "I enrolled in this course when i could free because of my school account but i now i cant get a certificate without upgrading my account. So the question is if i add the course in my linkedin without the certificate when i completed the course does it matter that i don't have a certificate?\n",
      "Very useful review. Thank you.\n",
      "Does the first course teach enough linear algebra to be able to follow a university level ML course? I already know basic high school LA btw.\n",
      "What I think is if you haven't done the math before I recommend to first cover Khan academy algebra, linear algebra and calculas playlist\n",
      "Any recomendations, books or courses for learning algorithms?\n",
      "What I was looking for. Ty\n",
      "What are your thoughts on their MSc in Machine Learning and Data Science (online)?\n",
      "Giles, I was sceptical about this video as I don’t remember you ever anything slightly negative about a book or course you’ve reviewed. So I’m glad you pointed out that the third course is the weakest. However, you were still far too generous. Marc deisenroth has exceptionally poor pedagogical skills and as someone who has used, understood and applied PCA in my work for several years, I felt desperately sorry for anyone who came across this as their first exposure. The third course in this specialisation is simply not worth a student’s time.\n",
      "Well, thanks to this video I'm ready to re-learn math the right way.. thank you.\n",
      "Hey Giles. Thank you for the review. Is this course better than the free Mathematics for Machine learning book that you had suggested earlier on your channel? Is it worth to spend money on this specialization when that free book exists? I am asking since you had given a positive review about that book too.\n",
      "Hey, if i want to learn this course but can't buy, how can I learn from youtube\n",
      "Hi Gile, any thoughts on Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization course?\n",
      "I was about to ask the same!\n",
      "Definitely go for it! Andrew is one the few exceptional teachers who knows what he's teaching. You can tell from the amount of enrollments that he's a very good instructor.\n",
      "Totally worth it :)\n",
      "It's definitely one I'd like to review. I haven't had the time to take it yet, but am planning to.\n",
      " @_AverageGuy  thanks! :)\n",
      "I agree with the point of that he's a great teacher and that the course is good and all of that, however, it should be noted that I think the course is better looked at as a way to gain a good foundation of the topic. Deep learning has branches such as computer vision, natural language, etc. He's covers them, however, obviously can't go all the way in depth. After the specialization, you should have a foundation of each branch, at leadt the ones covered, but be able to stem off to which to ever one you want. It should also be noted that I'm not saying that the course is covering the intuitions of each branch only, but I am also saying that it will be better suited for a foundation rather than making you an expert in each branch if that makes sense but at the same time, not a full out noob.\n",
      "does anyone have the notes for the specialization\n",
      "Sounds very compelling\n",
      "Your justification for why the assignments weren't \"too hard\" was all the convincing I needed that this class is bad. If I have to spend extra time digging in more depth online then there is no point to take that course in the first place. I'll just save some time and go straight to the research online step. Why take a course where they don't teach you what you need to know?\n",
      "Please make review on applied ai course.\n",
      "does this course help us with coding?\n",
      "I finished the Deep Learning specialization and would like to take another course/specialization and use my Coursera for students credit on another course. Which of these two is better to put on a resume when applying for a DS/ML/DL job?\n",

      "Is it THAT cold indoor?\n",
      "Better to take this before or after learning a bit of machine learning?\n",
      "Great video!\n",
      "would you advise to begin with python ? or html / css / JS  ?\n",

      "thanks for the review, but I thought they should have added the Statistics and Probability course as well. I am designing syllabus for Mathematics for Machine Learning for my master's students. I think this is the course which I will consider.\n",

      "Hey @fezekile228 I'm thinking of taking this or the meta back-end course. What skills have you gained after this, can you build full stack apps now? I found this course a little bit shallow when I looked through it. What is your take?\n",

      "Did it open any opportunities?\n",
      "Please how much did you pay for the course?\n",
      "I have been taking the course since September. I am on the last bit of the 7th certificate. There are 12 certificates total. It's excruciating to say the least and I am a developer. There are many parts where I do not think someone without prior knowledge would understand or figure out. Also, they barley go over how to do something and then expect you to know how to do it on a test. There is a huge issue with their virtual environments as well, which leaves me spending hours trying to find a fix through forums and blogs. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am still pushing through, but this course is a mess.\n",
      "Please sir, what is better to do? To take just the IBM fullstack certification course or to take the fronted + backend IBM certification courses? Please, I need an answer...thaks a lot for the video!\n",
      "If you are beginner better to take front-end with back-end. After feel free to go with full-stack.\n",
      "@SelfMadeProgrammer  Thank you sir...!!!\n",
      "anyone: There some careers assume prior knowledge. If a cloud developer course needs to explain what a network or server is, then you need to exit the course and go learn fundamentals. IT fundamentals are not taught in Cloud.\n",
      "Hi, to clarify, do you pay coursera subscription and course subscription? Or does the annual membership give you full access to this course with certification?\n",
      "In broad terms, average, which one has more career opportunities and will pay more money: AI/machine learning specialist or software developer?\n",

      "It s been a month I m studying this course, I find it very useful, lots of information, but the exercise part is not as brilliant. I hope that when I start the part with html css and js, there will be more exercises.\n",
      "I have recently completed the wev development fundamental and explore emerging tech on ibm. I also have seven years of freelance jog experience from Upwork, Fiverr and Guru. I am a top rated. But need to know are these courses actually worth getting job\n",
      "There just one thing I didn't understand about Coursera. Do I have to pay this IBM course separately or it comes with the 380€ yearly subscription?\n",
      "It depends on the precise IBM course but usually courses come with Coursera + subscription.\n",
      " @Daniel-Dann  I was talking about this one on the video, the full stack. I win anyway. Coding courses costs 4k where I live\n",

      "I am looking forward to taking this machine learning specialization as well. I’m planning out when to commit the time to study. Work will take up so much of my time in the day!\n",
      "That's great!! Congratulations!\n",
      "Really glad to see this channel branch out into different fields of analytics! ML knowledge is really valuable to have, especially when it is displayed as a portfolio project on a resume \n",
      "Your content is amazing, I'm doing the google certification right now and I'm looking forward to start my portfolio with some of your tutorials!\n",
      "I just finished week one of this course. There is definitely some math! If you're like me and its been a minute since you've really had to work through an equation, I would advise just slowing down and making sure you understand what you're looking at before moving on because each step builds on the last. \n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew Ng is a very good teacher, which is what makes the class work. ChatGPT is also good as an echo chamber. Try to explain the math to it, it will correct you if you get something wrong.\n",

      "So happy my college actually teaches machine learning in the DA program. So interesting.\n",
      "Alex, great video as usual.  Question for you, how do you balance work with your studies and side hustle? What's your schedule look like on a weekly basis?  I'm trying to make changes to my weekly habit to be more efficient.  Would love to hear from you. Thank you\n",
      "I have one of my long form videos that goes really in depth into this - hard to explain it all\n",
      "Hi Alex, I really hope that you can see this comment. I really appreaciate all of your amazing works so far. It is really helpful. Can you suggest any kind of other sources like books or podcads to have a mindset in data analytics? Because I struggle with which questions to ask, rather than which tools and how the codes are written. Thank you so much for that, you are such an amazing man!\n",
      "As always perfect review  thanks Alex\n",
      "Thanks for sharing this you are a great teacher \n",
      "My teacher can i get work after finish this courses ??\n",
      "Hey Alex, up to what level of python do you feel is required to take this specialization. Would you suggest to learn some prior math concepts before heading into this course?\n",
      "I think knowing a bit of Python is necessary. Probably knowing up to for loops or at least that level would be good to know. For math I would say algebra and basic statistics.\n",
      "Hi Shreyas ! I am already taking this course . For python you need to know what functions are , for loops , and what are methods . \n",
      "In terms of math all you need is college level math . And You dont need to go through anything advance as Andrew goes through them in lessons as well. \n",
      "One thing i must mention is that if you dont know python then understanding code will be difficult.\n",
      "Python or any programming knowledge or what I call computational thinking. Then for machine learning, you need statistics(300 level), Linear algebra( An absolute must) if you haven’t taken a course in linear algebra you will never understand machine learning period, and then some multivariate calculus and even basic calc. When I took the MITx class in ml it was clear people just didn’t understand what was going on.\n",
      "Sad that I have to pay for the specialisation because it is not included in my uni's partnership programme with Coursera, but I think the fee will be worth it :) Thanks for reminding us of Andrew Ng using Python for ML, Alex\n",
      "There are 3 courses within this specialisation. You can audit them for free. You will get the whole course just not graded assignments.\n",
      "Agreed\n",
      " @tonystark3224  but i want the certificates\n",
      "They give you 7 days free trial and it costs $49/month after that. If you can go faster, the total cost will be cheaper. I learned most of these stuff back in school, so I was able to go through these courses fairly quick. I am almost done with the 2nd week of the last course in exactly 2 weeks after starting with this specialization. Coursera planned this specialization for 10 weeks total (3+4+3). But if you do it 5x a week at 1.5 hours ea you should be able to finish it in less than 2 months.\n",
      "Off topic question. Please answer. How important is it to know statistics for data analyst. And if it is very important what would you recommend to learn? STATA, R STUDIO or anything else really. I am just stuck in regression and correlation. I mean I understand how it works but when you have a really big data manual calculation is not the best way. Just wanna know your opinion on this. Thank you\n",
      "Hi Alex and everyone, \n",
      "Pls I need help on how to upload my certificate from Coursera to Upwork. I've tried but Coursera is not among the list of options in the certification. Thank you all\n",

      "Thanks for the review\n",
      "Is the course also useful for ppl who are more into data analytics ?\n",
      "It's useful to know Machine Learning if you're working with data scientists. It was useful when I used to in my last position. You won't probably implement ML models.\n",
      "Hey Alex,\n",
      "Thanks for the review! Does this course come with a note? (e.g., a pdf or Jyputer notebook).\n",
      "Hi Alex,\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this one Specialization course enough to learn Machine Learning and dive into a career related to ML?\n",
      "It gives you a great foundation and is probably one of the best first courses you could take on ML. I don’t think it’s enough just by itself. You’ll need more practice of actually creating and implementing the models I think.\n",
      "Thanks Alex for a great review as always. Please what's the cost of this program?\n",
      "Coursera is a monthly subscription. So if you pay $49 per month you have access to this and all their other courses.\n",

      "Deeplearning.ai is his website which has a lot of other resources. This course is purely machine learning.\n",
      " @AlexTheAnalyst  Thanks\n",
      "You have convinced me to take the course . I paid the $48 let's see how it goes\n",
      "does this teach python as well ?\n",
      "I just found your page and I'm in the process of watching all of your videos. I just accepted a position of a administrative analyst and I like it so far, but I can't find much about others in this position. I don't get paid much ($17)but I'm okay with that for now because I'm entry and graduated with a BS in community health in 2020 and went from a screener,to medical records to my current position at the same clinic location. Where should I start to leverage on my new position of administrative analyst. I'm so sorry for the long comment and grammar but I'm searching for a sense of direction I desperately want to take this small opportunity and grow and I'm afraid that I might because stagnant. 2020 really did a number on my confidence in job hunting and how I'm perceived in the market because I was constantly turned down and overlook for things I felt like I was qualified for.\n",
      "That's great! Sounds like a good opportunity. I would try to learn all the technical skills of the position. If there really aren't any I would stay learning as much as possible. Your next position may want someone who has 1 yr experience to be more technical. I would also use that healthcare knowledge to your advantage and target healthcare companies for your next role.\n",
      "So cool\n",

      "Awesome, here it is! \n",
      "I took it and was impressed by it (this is Thomas Comerford btw, you responded to a comment of mine earlier today) in that it taught me a lot as a newbie. However, one thing that I noticed is that comparing it to the 4th course in the IBM cert, it doesn't utilize the requests library like the IBM one does. Personally, I think you're better off just skipping it if you're going to take the IBM courses, since the 4th course alone goes over everything and more that the specialization has. The only downside is that the IBM one is very fast paced, and it may feel like you aren't getting a total explanation of the content, so you'll just need to repeat stuff. One thing that you won't get in course 4 of the IBM cert is SQL with Python, but that's because it's another course.\n",
      "Oh very interesting! I and others reading this will really appreciate your insights here.\n",
      "I am an absolute beginner with 0 programming knowledge. I want to learn python from scratch, which will also be my first programming language. What do you think I should be doing? the IBM one or the michigan one?\n",

      "What alternative recommendation do you have to beginners who, and whom 'employers would be impressed' if you took? thanks\n",
      "I don't think anyone is impressed by someone knowing Python nowadays. It's pretty common. This is a great course for learning it, and from here you can branch off :)\n",
