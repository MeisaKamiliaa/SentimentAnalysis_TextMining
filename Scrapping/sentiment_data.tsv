I’m interested in doing tech courses
"Not yet, there are many things I need to understand about this platform? How can we communicate"
 @berryberrystrawberry2428  Video explanations but what I have used is very interractive and at the end of each video you can download worksheet with all the words just learned in the video. I have used yonsei university course to learn korean. The courses vary with different topics though.
 @gradehacker  I'm conversational by now. I use mix of free resourses including the coursera courses.
"Was looking for data analyst related boot camps come to find that my local uni charges over 13000, yet Coursera is about 59$"
"Video lectures are not the same as in-person learning, where your work is reviewed by a learned expert, with feedback given, and with the ability to ask questions for clarification. Peer-grades aren't worth much. So, it's a big price difference but a big difference in what you're getting. (Still, we all know higher ed is overly priced now.)"
"Thank you for this in depth review! I think you were really fair.\n\nMy university gives out free Coursera to all of the students who want it, so I don't have to pay for certificates, but I think I would probably continue using the platform even after I graduated and didn't 't have free access anymore.\n\nI think it is a great way to deepen your knowledge in your own field, or try other, unfamiliar fields as well. All of the courses are high quality and a lot of them are even enjoyable to take and they never feel like a chore.\n\nMy only problem is that peer reviews are nothing more than a joke. It is not even that you are not reviewed by experts, but your course mates usually put zero effort into reviewing your work. I never got any constructive criticism, they usually just say ""Good."", probably without reading what I wrote, or say ""Could have been better"".\n\nAlso, I wish they had more subjects in Humanities. There are only a couple of literature/culture courses."
So if you pay the 50 dollars per month you can do any of the courses that cost 50 dollars? its just kind of like a subscription to Netflix that gives you access to all of its shows apart from the advanced courses in this case that cost over $2000 USD??
If we buy one course is it life time accessible or it will be over within the given period of time
"Hello, I signed up for the Teamwork and Creativity course, it has 5 modules. I have just answered the tasks of the first module and taken the final exam, which is subject to a fee. I wanted to ask if we have to pass all five modules in this mentioned course to get a certificate or can we get a certificate after passing the each module?"
"You will get a certificate for each individual course and then one more when you complete all of them, aka complete the specialisation. This means that if you are only interested in completing certain courses, not all of them, you can, but to earn the final certificate you have to complete all of the courses."
Question: why do I get a certificate for each course I finish? Like they’ll be 4 parts and I get a certificate for all of them? Should it be just one final certificate at the end?
so if i take a free course & succeed i have the option to pay for the certificate when i’m done?
"Somehow it doesn’t let me have a free course, though it says the course is free. What may be a problem?"
Does it offer Accounting courses?
"I took several courses, great contents. My challenge here comes in and I need help with payment. I woud wish to do payment direct from bank is it an available option? Payment criteria CANNOT work for me where I am ."
"What about people that are not in university? \nI mean, I finished high school like 20 years ago and that was it.\nWould someone like me be able to learn the free courses? \nIt's not like I am that bright... unfortunantly."
I have only done two courses and it seems to have some boring structure and a lot of fluff. like they will have a 2 minute overview and then a 1 min conclusion on a topic I just saw.
What happens if we don't finish the subscription course in time?
"Coursera is not an accredited platform per se?  WTF? ""Coursera Certificates Are Not Accredited. While a Coursera certificate can look good on your resume, it's important to keep in mind that these certificates are not accredited. That means they likely won't be accepted as credit towards a degree or other formal education program."""
Are Coursera Certificates certifiable to get a job?
"What is difference between course, specialization and prifessional certificate. I am a pm and want to learn ux, but so many options came. No idea which one to pick frin the beginner filter :("
Is it possible to do the course if I don't have a computer? Can I do everything through phone?
"I would like to take some easy courses like virtual assistant, how do I go about"
Can anyone tell me what will be best courses for hospital and management
If I've time is it possible to compete any course in a month? Please reply
Dose Coursera provide video lectures too??
How can I call coursera.
Are the courses guided?
Brother I recently opened in coursera account but I can't get free courses how to I get free courses method please????
I want to learn c language from coursera and iam in my 1st year of engineering in ece i want a degree too

Do we have to give qyizzes under webcam submission . What are readings in courses
 @jegaevi7371  thanks for sharing is it for the professional course which had peer based assignment too.
 @gradehacker  They also offer financial aid for those who can't afford to pay for the courses.
Coursera is one of the biggest piles of trash I've ever seen. Major ripoff. Take a bootcamp course instead.
I completed 162 courses and 13 specialities on Coursera and i highly recommend it. The content quality of each course was really excellent
"and for how long have you been using Coursera, or took you to earned those?"
Can u recommend some language course like java and python on course era. And web development ?
I'm a college grad and took two courses from Coursera and graduated with two certificates from Coursera. I was able to gain 24 credits from Coursera and transferred the credits to another University!
Did the institution you took the courses from give you credits? Or did you have to show it to your university and convince them to give you credits?
My concern is are they accredited courses for big universities
I was a drop out student last 5 years ago. Now I found coursera as my way of motivation and success to have a higher rate of getting a job.
" @kentadran  Hello, if you will, could you please share your experience on coursera as of now? Did you get a job facilitated by those courses? Thank you."
" @Seeker7257 my experience is overwhelming positive, it did gave me a new chance of studying as I got no professional degree. Yes I did have a job facilitated by those courses. I am now working on a Chemical Factory"
" @kentadran  Thank you for reply, so accordingly, those courses have the potential to allocate an entry level job or the likes? That means, if we complete a particular course, we are left with opportunities, right? \n\nI am a collage dropout, and am wondering as to what these courses can do for me. Thank you."
" @Seeker7257  Yes, completing the course & having the knowledge of that will surely be something great to add unto your resume/cv/bio-data. There are several courses you can choose from, some requires payment some are not. I took a course which was made by a private university in the states and the instructor is really professional on her videos, even tho you don't have the full set of ideas behind that course it still explains to you like you are kindergarten on a class. They also provide transcripts for you to read if you have time. I even learned Japanese with it. Well my recommendation from choosing a course is something you really love and like. I happened to choose a course on my college days and ended up not liking it. So better look for the one that will totally make you grind for more."
"I took up business courses in Coursera, most especially in project management. Today, I am now a project manager for two marketing agencies in the US. Coursera helps me to finally use my knowledge I learned in that platform in my role."
That's great!! congrats. What is the best Project management course at coursera which will make me understand everything about PM?
" @RichardWalls  As a digital marketer, I just realized I needed to know more about project management since they go well together. So, I decided to learn more about it. I started leading projects but I didn’t have the title. I applied last year and my different clients were impressed by my experience and credentials and decided to give me the project manager role in their companies.\n\nCoursera helped me advance my career. ️"
 @zaidalmashan517  I love UC-Irvine’s project management courses. They’re straightforward and they helped me to be equipped in my role.
Do you have a degree besides a Coursera certificate?
This is the first of very few comments that have confirmed a career gain from coursera.  Most of them are either flexing on completing a bunch of courses or raving about how great they are without saying anything about actually getting a job from it.  Hopefully your not just a bot.
I just started on coursera last week and I can't believe that I didn't do so earlier. I think the contents are put together much better and nore professional than Udemy.  I give it a 5 .
Yup am wanting to do a bunch of courses on coursera. The good thing...is it’s free unless you are wanting their certificates.
Do you still recommend Coursera?
"Same, I completed a course from Bocconi and it was the first online course ever, that I enjoyed from the beginning. It motivates you and they do a great job on explaining topics to someone with few or no prior knowledge."
"I have 0 self confidence and have never taken anything beyond high school.  I know I know, that's crazy!  After seeing what this online course is all about and currently in a mid-life crisis, I want to try at least one course.  I'd like to have a certificate in something...I was actually looking at the Cyber Security course and may take the plunge....Thanks for the helpful information."
All the best! Hope you plunge into that course and complete it.
"Thanks for this reflection, coursera certificates really add value in career advancement, another important element that distinguish coursera with other learning platforms is financial aid option."
How do you get the certificate in Coursera?
"Some certifications give you credit hours, now there are degrees and masters on the website. I’m in IT support, looking into cyber security analyst, and AZU’s computer science masters with a specialization in cybersecurity\n\nPS. I’m coming from a non tech background. I only know CSS, HTML and SPSS. I majored in Sociology at UVA. It’s very doable guys! Don’t give up, I love Coursera!"
"Yes I love it too, I highly recommended to my friends using Coursera and pay for it"
I'm currently a new pre-nursing student and plan on taking Coursera's anatomy and physiology course prior to actually enrolling in that course with my school so that I can frontload the knowledge I need so that when I actually take the course I can be as successful as possible. I'm super excited I came across Coursera.
"I've been studying from MOOCs for years and always have come across Coursera (paying money for certain courses has turned me away), but now I am reconsidering and will be working on the equivalent of a doctorate and actually having something to show for it. I've wasted money over the years on superfluous things but have come to realize investing in education (outside of buying textbooks) is is well worth it."
Hi Richard. I was looking for the perfect review on Coursera and I am in the right place. Thank you for this video. I am starting classes on Coursera.
hi my friend! aftr 9 month have coursera has been helpfull for your interests?
Coursera is brilliant. All courses I have completed have supported me in my career.️
Taking Coursera courses has been the best thing that happened to me in the last 2 years.
I appreciate your review. I completed my first Coursera course just recently. Mine was available through the university where I work so it was free. I agree the peer-grading feedback was hit or miss. I did learn a lot from reading what other people turned in for assignments. And I personally tried to provide decent feedback. Some of the feedback was really thoughtful. Some was not even written in complete sentences! LOL! But I enjoyed the course a lot and will probably continue in the certification it is part of.
Coursera will give you skills but your BODY OF WORK is what will get you hired. You need a portfolio of work nowadays to stand out. Merely knowing and having the certificate is not enough. Start a Youtube Channel and/or website to showcase. your skills. This is a MUST.
"I've just finished the AWS IOT course.. it was not for beginner and fortunately i am familliar with AWS from last year. Some exercise was written in 2019 and as 2021 AWS has upgrading some services,  so after exercise 3 it is not meet the required upgraded version. But after all,  it is boosting my confidence for this pandemic era as coursera approved my financial aid."
I commend you on clarifying a little of the difference between the specialization and the courses.
Thank you for making this video. I'm stuck between taking a payroll course(s) with Coursera or taking a course with CUNY. I live in NYC and the price point is a huge difference. I'm currently paying for my son's college tuition and was wondering if Coursera would be worth the money as I would like to further my knowledge in finance but don't want to waste money. I truly appreciate your honesty and thoroughness.
I've taken Cybersecurity in college and Coursera and Coursera was excellent! They explained everything in a way I could better understand. The free course is nothing but listening so making sure you takes notes is highly important to make sure you know you are learning & understanding the content. Highly recommend 
"Coursera is great, but most of the courses I have done there were built in such way that if you do not achieve 100% score, you probably can not read. Exception being e.g. Pavel Pevzner's Bioinformatics specialisation or the original 2012 version of the Probabilistic Graphical Models course (has been diluted and split into several courses now, so not sure about that one any more).\n\nIn this respect, I found MITx courses on edX  better (and I like edX UX significantly more as well - yes, this is subjective). In order to pass those, you have to understand the subject matter, apply it in a creative way to a problem you have never seen before - so you have to actually think as opposed to Coursera's norm of simple recall quizzes. The only problem of those MITx courses is that they run on extremely crazy schedules, so having full-time job and/or family makes it almost impossible to do them simply because of lack of time."
I’m debating on taking courses has anyone taken any and have been able to advance in their careers?  Has your employers or others recognized the education from Coursera
Udemy is better for learning Python and SQL.  Learn and retained next to nothing after 4 months of python and SQL on Coursera.  Udemy has better hands on so far.  Actually it is almost all hands on.  \n\nCurrently taking 100 days to code and SQL boot camps.
"I'm stopping at 5 - 6 specializations and 2-3 individual courses. The last 3 specializations will based on change management, transformation, and SQL. Should be done by the end of May.... has taken 3 months, but will hopefully be worth it."
Hi there!\nSo I study using Coursera. I have taken a few courses on variety of fields I am interested in. I did an introductory marketing course ( from Wharton) and currently doing an accounting course ( also from Wharton). I wanna learn more about different branches of business as I am still trying to figure out what I like the most and what I should choose to pursue my degree. Now I wanna learn about business administration .Can you recommend me some great courses about business management or business administration for newbies on Coursera?\nThank you 
"@RichardWalls My company gives us access to the Coursera+ classes, some of which are taken straight from the UIUC iMBA courses. From what I could see, if you take these courses ahead of enrolling in the iMBA, you can use them towards your degree. Having been a part of both Coursera and iMBA at UIUC, do you know if this is an additional way to save some $$ on the 12 or so credits I currently have access to? Or is it something that you inevitably have to pay for when transferring those credits for consideration/grades? Thanks man, great channel! UIUC and Boston University applications going in this week, in large part thanks to your content!"
"Do they have due dates on the NBA courses for assignments? I’m at a community college and the professors set due dates for assignments. And sometimes we get 1 to 2 chapters per week. Well, really an average of one chapter. Plus of midterm if that happens depending on the professor and sometimes on rarer cases a final exam. What is Coursera like?"
Awesome video!\nI am actually thinking about doing a course about Legal Tech and Startups!\nThanks!\nCheers 
"As a person with no degree but interested in cyber security, would completing cyber security related certificates/courses allow me to step into the job field on a mid-high skill level?"
What do you think about Forage’s courses for college students trying to figure out a career path and how does it compare to Coursera?
"I would really like to know if you think it'll be possible to get into the job field of management using Coursera content, knowing that I have no degree. Thank youuu"
Great content. What do you think about Vonza platform?
"Can one put these on a resume and get a job for example Comptia + and Security + certs and get a job are they accepted by most employers or are these ""decorative wallpaper"" like a continuation learning which is nice and all lets employers know you seek improvement."
"I’m in college for bachelors in cyber security, but I want to do IT or project management while still in college  in coursera would that make sense? Or be worth it ?"
"Hi Richard, \nOne question: If I complete for example a financial accounting certificate from Penn University, do I get the certificate from Penn University or from Coursera?\nThanks"
" @RichardWalls  Thanks, but will the certificate show I completed the course from Penn University?"
" @richardcontell1314  yup, but it does not counts as a Credit, unless the course says so. I did a course from yale about psych and it has the yale logo and the coursera as well. It says you completed a xourse from that uni from coursera, your name and the teachers signature"
"I just did Microsoft Azure Fundamentals and it was riddled with problems. \nBroken links to Azure sandbox environments, steps that mention non-existent settings, or are in a different place now, inconsistent video player functionality from lesson to lesson - some fullscreen, some don't, some you can change speed, some you can't. And mid video tests that cut the presenter off mid-sentence and pop up before the fact have been taught. The whole experience was infuriating. Are their other courses falling out of sync like this, or was this just really bad luck?"
Greetings and Salutations \n\nFrom the free course offered in \nNew California Republic 
"Tried one course - Python programming basics. It was a lot of ""water"" in what seemed to be like an intro to an actual course, but then there was a ""test"", which one had to pass to get further. I was extremely frustrated to put it mildly, seems like the aim of such ""test"" is not to test ones knowledge, but with how much BS one is willing to put up with.\nUser interface isn't brilliant either - here on YouTube you can use fast backward and forward, if you missed something, on Coursera it just isn't there. I don't remember anymore, what other issues with UI there was, but I recall myself thinking how ironic it is to have those for a site, which claims to teach web design and programming skills."
"I tried to access coursera, but they give me only 7 day free trial. Can anyone say to me how I got the courses for free, please"
Course content excellent but very limited support resources ie no in person chats spend so much time trying to find out how to find a template needed to complete peer reviewed exercises ect.. overall the course organization can be poor but the content I have found to be exceptional.
"I was working 9$ front desk gym , Coursera courses saved me now I’m building a data center"

Debating whether or not I want start using coursera.
Will I get a paid certificate if I completed only one course out of a whole specialization?
I badly wanted to take a course but i don't have a laptop. I wish it could be available on just a phone.
"Do you know any details how to get in touch with workers there? Cuz I’ve completed the course, but can’t get a certificate… \nThanks for your reply in advance)"
"What do you recommend, guys, taking psychology courses at Coursera or IAP Career College? I’m not sure. Can anyone help me? Because I have searched of Coursera, and it has a D- grade from the Better Business Bureau. IAP has a high grade from Better Business Bureau."
thank you for explaining... \ni just wanna know how can i get free certificate from coursera when I'm done with certain courses. I'm from Sudan and where I'm from visa card and master card still not working lol.
"Hi, Rich! If ever I want to enroll myself to this program, it'll take 4 years, right? And will there be payment in case I want it to be credited as a degree diploma? Does coursera credit my finished 1st year, like that?\n\nA response from you will be sooo helpful!"
"I’m currently a new sport science student,and I started taking courses about sport science and science of exercise,do you think this degree would help me when I want to apply to another university around the world?"
i cant see the date they make the course how i can see it?
I’ve learned UI/ UX alone without courses in 1 month ! Only Google .
Can anyone confirm the cost? I am seeing $39 monthly. Do courses vary in cost in addition to the monthly $39 subscription fee?
Richard Walls - Career Dev & Finance It’s such unbelievable price comparing those profit making courses provided by some professional bodies.
Sir can you tell me from these courses how i will get a job mean i have done many courses but i dont know ho to use these courses for sell or earn a money from this. Can you help me how can i get a job from these courses Thanks.

I'm thinking about taking online animation course which platform do you recommend?
Is there tests at the end of the paid courses?
Hi I am planning to take some coding related courses...Is it worth to take it via course era or via universities
"Hi, just a quick question. \nFor ANY free course they offer, you can get a paid certificate in the end? \nSo all of the process is free, but if you want a certificate to prove you've completed the course, you have the option to get a paid certificate?"
Do you get a job with Coursera certificate or not?
"Thank you for Video!\nI need an advice, please...\nI study online in university but I while I am studying I need more experience and skills which I do not get from university. I am thinking to try to  get a course from coursera, but I am not sure if I can work with certificate from coursera? Because I didn't graduate yet, but I want to start working, can I work with that certificate? Is it possible or not ?\n If you know any good courses for event management and Marketing, I would appreciate it !! thank you "
"I'm interested but I don't see how people whom have been high school drop outs can now attend Berkley. My question is say I use coursera and I get my B.A in computer science and I apply to IBM London, and the recruiter sees I've got a b.a from Harvard University. He decides to check with the dean of Harvard to make sure I've graduated from there. Is that dean or registrar office going to say ""hey, yeah he graduated from here I can see him in our program"". Or will they not have any information of me ever using there services."
"1. does it has weight in the course, 2-- will they help us get job, 3 how will be course conduct via zoom link, 4-- what type of job will i get, 5 after completing do we get job anywhere --   Salary how much i get ?\nthank u"
Cuestión si I can take more then one course for same price ?
"i can't believe the amount of courses you guys are saying you take. is this average? is this necessary to remain competitive for your fields? i often try to learn things on my own, but i haven't been able to use one of these services. i would like to bring myself to the level that i have real certifications or other things i can use to get a job. but sometimes i wonder if it's worth it or that what really  counts is real experience. is it possible to move into a new career with one of these certificates? is this similar to actual college courses? the price is not extremely cheap and i wouldn't expect it to be if this is legit, but i don't even have a computer set up at the moment and i question whether or not it will be worth it in the long run."
It is not just about certifications but also knowledge delivered in a structured and bit sized manner which sticks with you if you do the courses correctly and with patience. Certifications are the proof that yes you have the drive to upskill yourself in the field of your interest. It shows your own drive to improve yourself to be a better version of you.
Which IoT courses did you take?
" @RichardWalls  Thank you so much, for getting back to me Richard Walls. This is definitely a great starting point for me. I will take this course, and I see that I can enroll today. I appreciate the career development and finance mentoring you offer, it's awesome! I was particularly interested in your journey to becoming a product manager especially in the IoT space (I am working for a tech company that develops software for IoT spaces) . I aspire to be a product manager soon, and I'm working towards it. Thanks for the guidance. I have my eye on a couple of online MBAs to consider, thanks to your video on that... Brilliant!! I am grateful.\nAny thoughts regarding working towards a Product management certification? Is this worth pursuing, and could you please recommend a great certification that is recognized internationally?  Many thanks!"
Do you recommend it for web development courses ?
I might have guessed YouTube would put a coursera thumbs up to feed its data scrounging operations.

Can someone do some courses in Coursera or EdX for me. I will pay him money. I just need the certificate by my name. It will be of great help.
Is there any courses on there where you get free cert after completion of the course without even applying for financial aid?
Hello  Now a days Coursera is providing Master's and Bachelor's degree courses is it Valid to learn on Coursera? And do they provide Financial aid/ free degree if we apply financial aid for this Bachelor's degree?
You're joking right?\n\nCoursera is a scam
Have been on Coursera since its beginning \nHave taken so many fabulous classes and now on my latest one: Women Spirituality in the Middle Ages ️\nCoursera is my intellectual and spiritual nourishment \nThank you to their extraordinary Team ️
"Hello sir, good evening.. this video has been helpful.. im thinking of starting a course in Coursera. I have lots of questions. I don’t know if you can give me your IG account. I’ll be most grateful."
I took Python for everybody on Coursera. And it was the best programming course I took. Love dr Chuck!
What was the name of the course ? And how much did it cost?
I wish you could reviews the MOOCs by university of Helsinki. I think they have good courses and talking about it might help people to gain the free availibilty of such courses
I'm living in a 3rd world country and I can't afford to pay $50 per month for courses!!
"Daniel, I appreciate your review of Coursera. Can you make a comparison video with other programming platforms? There are many of them and it's getting tough to choose."
"Hai,appreciate your vd,but may I ask if I learn from coursera the subjects that I didn’t learn during diploma,n can I know if the credits can be transfer when I study for degree?"
You don't lose access to courses after the end of subscription and you can Audit courses for free
Coursera is extremely popular these days. Thanks for video
Great review I have been using Coursera for almost 6 months now it does have some great Courses & I believe it is worth the price.
 @Lala-xq2ht   yeah it depends on what courses you’re looking to take but keep in mind just because you have a certificate it doesn’t guarantee you a job
I took 3 courses from coursera and graduated with two certificates. Nice platform. recommend
I just started on coursera last month and I can't believe that I didn't do it earlier
coursera is the best! I found out about this platform because of you
great video! I learn Coding on Coursera only
you are wrong man! some of coursera certificates really add value
Is coursera available in Arabic?
I have been on Coursera since 2019. perfect platform for learning
I completed 8 courses on Coursera and I highly recommend it.
I like that Coursera has lots of advanced lvl courses especially in data science
for me Udemy is better for learning Python and SQL
Coursera is brilliant. Like it
any good webdev courses on coursera?
"Coursera is a bit expensive, but it worth it"
I think the content on Coursera is much better than on Udemy.
I tried out udemy - I like the fact that they have an automatic course progress tracking and gives you a certificate right away as soon as you finish the course.
Udemy was  good for getting my feet wet in software development. Their rating systems help you choose the best courses. Their prices are very reasonable.
"What I don't like of LinkedIn Learning is that their Learning Paths sometimes feel disjointed, especially when it comes to web development or any other programming language, which they also have but a handful of them. They start with the fundamentals, but the next course, although it progresses on what you learned, it is not related, nor it develops upon the previous course. \nIn contrast, Udemy has bootcamps and they start from the fundamentals and build up from there, following a path that is engaging. \nIt is still very good quality material (LL), and I would absolutely recommend it if it were cheaper, but sadly they want you to pay for all the LinkedIn premium ""advantages"" you may never need just to unlock the learning experience."
LinkedIn Learning is free if you have a library card or enrolled in post-secondary institutions (in canada atleast)
We found skillshare to be youtube tutorials but piad. Coursera or Udemy is the way to go.
I hate coursera i paid a yearly subscription and i regret it
You should have mentioned the Financial Aid availability on Coursera
I think you forgot to say that udemy courses are regularly on sale at 80% so they cost less than 20$ for a lifetime accès thats huge différence
This is the most information rich video on YouTube about the comparison of different learning platforms. And yet it has so few views! 
"0:00  Consider online learning platforms if you lack time or funds for traditional college.\n0:46  Coursera: Offers diverse academic courses with affordable options, including programs from prestigious universities like Yale and Google.\n2:31  Skillshare: Subscription-based platform with a wide range of creative courses, though lacking official certificates or university-level programs.\n  Udemy: Provides a vast repository of specialized courses with lifetime access after a one-time payment and a 30-day refund policy.\n  EdX: Offers free access to high-quality courses from top universities, with optional paid certificates recognized for college credit.\n  LinkedIn Learning: Subscription-based platform focusing on professional development, particularly beneficial for business-related skills and networking."
"No you don't get check-ins , you just have to go trough all the videos and you will get a certificate, you don't have a time limit so once you buy a course you can finish it when you can."
"Hi, what is your thoughts on YouLearnity? My course is the only one on there, lol"
Which would be best for b learning a new language
I want to learn online course in hospitality management in housekeeping I have already working experience in housekeeping but I don't have education certificate please say me which website is good in premium
What do you think about Alison courses?
Aahh thank you so much! I was really wondering if EDX is legit. Because i see lots of negative reviews about it. So i was unsure if i should continue with my program with them or not. \n\nThank you for sharing info about all these other learning platforms. \n\nYou are an angel!!!️
Regularly I use Udemy for paid courses but these are knowledge based Solid realtime tricks does not cover in it. Coureera is little tricky where few topics are moderate & other high end certification are high price.
Learnbay or Coursea which is better option for Freshers
"Please make a video about your experience taking the course, I want to know if the platform is good for learning."
"I’m look for options trading , course ? Any suggestions"
Cam anyone give me the feedback of learnx courses if they have get an enrollment??
Im new i was graduated on alison but i need something new on ather platform
"How is New Skills Academy?\n\nCan some of their certifications get me a new job/career?\n\n800 courses. I definitely would not ever but a whole year membership, as I probably would really only ever be interested in 2-4 of their programs."
Best online learning platforms for beginners music production? ANY SUGGESTIONS?!!?
"I almost forked out on a ""learning people"" course, good job I did some deep research before I commited"
" @gradehacker  I know it is completely online based education learning,  but I want to know from which country it is conducted, thank you"
How about great learning platform?
Please do a specific video on courses for day trading
"hello boss, what courses do you recommend for retail businesses?"
"Define ""top"" - There are many other platforms out there, depending on what criteria you base your definition of ""top""."
It's just a marketing strategy. Udemy is quite frankly one of the lowest quality MOOC providers. Coursera ad Edx are easily the best since they're courses are affiliated with actual universities.
hello my friend can i get a e-commerce course
I’m stuck between Udemy y Coursera for social media  marketing
i dont know the best but coursera is certainly the worst
Edx is worst.....my favourite is Coursera
"Nah, just are created for different people. I have tried both, and I can admit that edX is more damanding than Coursera and hence, more tedious. Sometimes, their assignments forces you to think out of the box. In other words, they force you to interiorize the knowledge by hart. However, Coursera is more of a guided path towards a very simplified and  narrow goal. To provide an example, the Harvard professional certificate at edX for Data Science takes more than a year to complete. The similar ones (IBM) at coursera take less than a year. This just reflects the point that edX offers a more broad preparation while Coursera reduces the content to increase learning speed. I am not saying that one is better than the other, they are just simply created for a different audience."
I want short low quality courses that are very expensive. Who do I choose? Please help!
You think learn something on courseras can guarantee you a job

The fact that you actually took the course and completed it before giving your opinion says a lot.  +1sub
You do not need to take the course to know it's bullshit. But I am glad there is another professional out there speaking the truth.
I came in here just to say Google’s course is one of the main reasons I passed my Security+. I received a high score too. So if your planning on taking the Security+ take Googles course first
@prostigeMarketing  if the cyber course feels too hard start with A+. A+ will give building blocks for Sec+
"I've almost completed it, currently at the end of 7th course (Python). \nI've had a exposure to Linux before. Just like you said, Except python (course 7) most of the Google cyber security course doesn't focus  or show or teach on actual applications that we'd use. \nBut what i CAN say is i'd rather have this than having aimlessly looking around without direction. and it did and DOES help me get confidence to go further. I just view it as first step, that's all."
" @JonGoodCyber   ""you will never convince me of any significant value in certifications that employers don't list in job postings"" -   well, yes, it's new one.  Only time will show.\n""That means if you do not get hands-on experience,"" -  a big majority of Sec+ certified folks have just done video course +  probably have read book + practice exams. That applied to 95+% as reddit comtpia's channel and discord channel have demostrated. Sad but true. You're talking about ideal approach of Sec+ certification which included labs which will cost  extra 100-200$ and only small percentage of people want to pay for it. While Security+ is only multiple choice + PBQs it's essentially  still purely theoretic exam."
"The Google Cybersecurity training offered in partnership with Coursera is one of the best and affordable beginner level certification. I think your review primarily based on your expertise, ignoring this training was ment for absolute beginners. I also noticed your replies of comments here are directing viewers to your online course platform, this in my opinion also contributed to your bias review. Honestly I'm enjoying the content. Again I will like you to show proof of completing the whole course in 4 days because I'm battling this for some months now. Thank you."
"i have done this in 3.5 days. I can give you proof :) I enrolled last Fri, Sep 27, 6:58 AM and finished Mon, Sep 30, 11:51 AM. Those dates I copy pasted from the email I got when I enrolled and when I receive the congratulatory email on my last course.\n\nUnfortunately I have to pay for certificate which I thought I will not have to :)"
I am actually currently taking the Google Cyber security course I'm on the third one which I guess would be course 3... Anyway I greatly appreciate your honest opinion because now I think I should probably lean more towards going ahead and studying for the security plus instead. I can put my valuable money and efforts into that which will get me further than this one would. Again I greatly appreciate your brutal honest opinion and it's helped me see which way I need to go. Thank you sir.
"Your review is 100% true! When I reviewed the course outline, I was quite surprised that they had SQL and Python as part of their curriculum. While those are nice to have, it's overwhelming for any beginner. Thanks for the real, and honest review. "
"Yes, you should have some serious understanding of how networks work before taking this class, I got my Network+ and took a CCNA class before taking this cert course. I thought this course was amazing, it taught me a lot. Don't knock it. It is so much better than most of the cybersecurity courses out there."
"Interested in google courses on Coursera in general and cyber secruity was one that seemed to be pushed quite a lot, so seeing your truthful evaluation on it is extremely helpful. Thanks Jon you did good :)"
I’m in course seven and everything you said in on par with my experience thus far. I would have enjoyed more in depth analysis of packets but I’ll have to get that from Chris Greer vids. At this point I’m just gonna finish it. It was something to do during summer so my interests wouldn’t wane. Now that classes have resumed it’s an afterthought compared to my college courses.  Thanks for your valuable insight.
Currently half way through the course on the Linux portion. I have been enjoying the amount of knowlegdge i'm soaking in based on this whole course. This for me was the best way to introduce myself in the field as i'm currentlly working in help desk for about 1.5 yeears and looking for the next step. I'm definetly looking forward to using the sec + voucher especially since my employer agreed to pay for the exam with the voucher once I complete this certificate. I am already prepard to study for the 601 after I finish this course. Any advice on what I should be doing now as im going through the course or even after completetion besides taking the sec+ ?
"I am new to the tech world , and I have so much interest in Cyber Security. Is it ideal for me to start with Coursera ? Please I need urgent help"
"I would recommend doing some research, be sure to chk their reviews.   Also Compare courses & prices before signing up. There’s some that have really good deals while others charge $800 more than the avg rate. Rn almost all prep courses have the same syllabus."
"i've seen ads for these a bunch of times and I've been in a situation where I can do a career change if I wanted to, and I have a slight curiosity in doing cybersecurity. I searched up the course and then decided to check out reviews and looked at yours first because of the ONLY UNSPONSORED in the title. I was totally about to put down some money to do the course up until now. Thanks!"
Josh when are you going to start posting again would love to hear updates on both your courses and the outlook and what jobs to look out for with cuts occurring in certain areas and for people transitioning from a non tech job.
"So a beginners course is basic, omg I never excepted that"
"I started taking the course.  It seemed like a good primer.\n\nI'm doing it on weekends and using my weeknights to learn stuff on try hack me.  I really like learning in parallel like this.  I also enjoy the bite size pieces from thm.\n\nI'm hoping that this can be the beginning to a career, but I'm only done with course 4, so halfway through, and I'm going through the junior soc rooms at thm.\n\nIt's pretty fun though."
"I to the MS security course and the google one, the MS one covers a lot of the same ground but also feels super marketing heavy this time with a focus on Azure/AD and other MS products, but it does sort of go through Azure/AD 101 which is very important and something that the google course skips over completely."
"I've started the Cybersecurity course, had to take a break due to personal reasons, but I am hoping to finish it soon.\n\nFrom what I have seen in it, it's fairly good. Although I have no cybersec background. Maybe this video isn't sponsored by Google but seems like it's affiliated with a course that is a direct competitor. \n\nI think lots of people think this is an ALL IN ONE cert, although it says in the description that it was built alongside CompTIA as an intro for people with no background and want to take the security+ cert. which is the main reason I am taking this one just to get BASIC knowledge so that I can take that, along with other studying, and attempt security+. (also apparently you get a discount for it lol) \n\nI will hopefully be back shortly with an update once I finish the course :D"
Thank you for the honest review..I have a question?\nQ: what course or study do u recommend that’s gonna make u “from no knowledge of IT to a cybersecurity professional”?
"if a person already did that course, what would you recommend they do afterwards, also lets say a person already found a job in that field, would you still recommend other type of education to follow up on?"
I already passed my sec+ over a year and a half ago. I'm using this as a refresher course to go back over material I haven't looked at in awhile.
"Man, i just graduated with my bachelor's degree in cyber security (miami) and i started studying for my security+ 601. I started google cyber security professional cert because i felt school didnt teach me anything and now im at my witts end about what to do. I just want a decent entry level job to learn what i was actually learning to love."
"Thank you for the honest review! As someone who is new to the Cybersecurity field (I’m currently 3 courses deep into the Google Cert) I saw this very as a good way to get discounted access to the CompTIA Security + cert. In your opinion, does it seem worth it to complete the course or is that the sunk cost fallacy talking?"
"I signed up after watching multiple cybersecurity professionals recommending this course as a first step towards cybersecurity career in order to see how you like it. Finished 1 course in 3 days, currently on 2 course.  I am gonna do a bootcamp at a local community college."
"6:30 minor correction that the 6 month estimate is based on 7 hours per week.  If one were to study 7 hours per day, that'd almost a full time job lol and they'd complete the course in about 3-4 weeks."
"My part time warehouse job at Fedex pays for courses so I took a 6 month Cyber Security course at a local college but felt that I didn't retain some of the info as I learn best with CBT based training. Full time I work for an ISP that is very Cisco (CCNA), Nokia (NRS1) and basic cloud centric but I would like to break into Cyber. Looking at taking this course then some hand-on ones like Hack the Box...."
What online course/program do you recommend for beginners wanting to get into Cybersecurity?
 @JonGoodCyber   I’m new to cybersecurity looking to start a career as a SOC Analyst what online course would you recommend for somebody like me with no experience and working a full time job. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated
I’m 35 years old. I haven’t worked in 3 years because I was in a coma for 3 months back in 2021. I want to start a new career in technology. Will Coursera be good for me?
 @JonGoodCyber  yeah I think it was a good first attempt. I think the main issue is making it so broad. They should just have longer courses geared at different domains
"You legit guy. So many talk without actually taking the course!\n\nI tried the course but abandoned it, did not like it for many reasons. \n\nThanks for your honesty you earned a subscriber."
So as someone who have zero knowledge and no background in computer science and wanted to learn cybersecurity what do you recommend where should he start from ?and what course he should start with to get all the basic ideas. NEED FOR SOME GUIDANCE
"Thanks for this, I’m currently on Course 3 & i feel like I’m haven’t really learned too much… just a bunch of definitions they’re cramming into my head. I also believe there’s no way this is “professional” it seems super basic knowledge, I do plan on further expanding my knowledge after it though. Perhaps a associates degree & there’s places near me that offer 11mon actual irl training hands on at this one base I might look into. I’m still enjoying it though because I’m 25 and just now realizing I enjoy tech a lot & want to do something in the industry & cyber really has me excited."
"As a beginner, the course is perfect to get to your feet in cybersecurity at all. Just brings some light on the career path really. But if you already have basic knowledge and already have other certs, then the Google cert will be no use to you of course!"
" @JonGoodCyber  Agreed cause To be honest, i am halfway through the course. And i am about to ditch it as well lol. I see what they mean. The first half of the course is great to learn terms and stuff, but after like course 5, they kinda do recaps on the previous courses and it’s all the same stuff now. Just said in different ways. \n\nWhat do you recommend i start next? I’m new to cybersecurity. But I’m not sure if i should start the comptia A+ or go straight for the security+. Also finishing the Google cyber cert for the 30% off on the security+ is the real reason why people even finish the course tbh. I just don’t like to waste time lol"
" @JonGoodCyber Thank you! I’ve decided to stop at the python course. They are word dumping even more and it is difficult with the way they teach. And the labs for the python course suck because it’s not hands on. I would rather learn on my own with the actual program and YouTube vids on python and SQL. And yeah the discount voucher is really not worth it, I’ve got what i needed from the courses, because now they are just milking it lol. It was fun to learn before they started to repeat themselves. \n\nDecided to go back and do the comptTIA A+ and then the security+ certifications."
" @JonGoodCyber  ""How do I know people are quitting? The discussion forums are part of the requirements.."" Not really, you can skip it, I did it initially but skipped all the other ones and still doing the course. It's a great course. Is it going to land me a job? No, probably not. But i never expected it to."
"Alright, I kinda change my mind. I agree with you. Certificates are worthless unless it teaches you how to do the job vs just giving you a piece of paper like a liberal arts degree. However, anything is better that nothing and it shows employers your possible dedication to learning the trade. But nothing beats actually learning the trade and being obsessed with the craft vs just trying to get a job via a piece of paper alone."
"Similar in how a lot of people see the CISSP a mile wide and an inch deep in content, but with this, I would say at best, this is only a half a inch deep. I will say for a person that is inquisitive, it left me wanting to learn more. Not going over Windows and AD is something I realized I should have learned before even being exposed a threat, vulnerability, or risk, incident response, wireshark, python ect. I always felt it should have been redone and behave like the BTL1 cert operates in being lab heavy in all their courses."
"I treated the course as a general introduction to cybersecurity so that I could really confirm I held interest in pursuing it. I had very low expectations for the career group access or even getting any responses on their boards (which was dismal most of the time). But I do feel it served its purpose, and I finished it within about a month so I think I ended up paying the 50 bucks. Wasn't too bad."
"I took the IT fundamentals course provided by coursera as I don’t have any certificates yet I’ve been in my MSP lvl 1 tech role for a year and want to move on to a specialization i picked cybersecurity and have no idea which certs I should go with there being soc, sec, cissp, and all kinds of roles while I think if your an absolute beginner and no nothing about computer I do think the fundamentals is a good start as a supplement with studying for comptia a+ security+ or network and possibly a ccna."
 @JonGoodCyber  I agree that there are a lot of entry level training courses/programs available I think there is a lot of not a very general or laid out path for specializations as there are tons and tons of different certifications. What are your thoughts on getting into cyber security and where would one start or should start?
Half way through the course. agree most things with you..would you review the microsoft one as well?
"I share your point of view. I would say that this course is just an appetizer and will never guarantee you to land a job, unless a company is willing to continue training you.\nThis course is a foundational help to continue your learning journey. I decided to take the SOC path and with only the Google course nobody will give me a job.\nTons of knowledge and technical additional stuff are necessary to learn before even to think about an internship, for example."
"Well I think the google cyber certificate is one of the best as I have taken a A few months of this certs, it touched on thing other certs or courses never touched"
You mentioned it will take 6 months to complete if you study 7 hours per day. That sounds intimidating for a basic course. Did you mean per week?\nThank you for a detailed review!
How long did it take you to finish the course?
I really appreciate this candid review. I was thinking of taking this course as a refresher before diving into my Sec+ studies since I got a month of Coursera for $1. I'm thinking I'll apply that effort in another direction.
"I've been researching a career change into cyber for a few weeks now and I've yet to encounter anyone knowledgeable and credible who's #1 sponsored or #2 hasn't demonstrated that they haven't taken any of the courses they're reviewing. After years in a certain area in the military, it's somewhat easy to spot a BSer fairly early in some of these videos. You mentioned that this cert belongs in the ""trash"" but I didn't catch your recommendation(s) as a better alternative to newbies looking to get started"
" @JonGoodCyber  yeah, the goal is to prepare myself to start learning skills to enter the field, but I am starting from scratch. I'll explore the ebook as well. Thank you."
This course alone may not be able to land you a job right away but it will teach you a lot and give you a great foundation to get you started and is affordable. It helped me pass the Security+.
I chat GPT’d this course in my current role (Systems Administrator) and leveraged it for a raise. \nI’m currently studying for my CISSP but needed a little bonus on my yearly review lol
"Thanks Jon! I thought the same thing, when the clowns started pushing that certification. No employer is asking for that certification but they push it like it’s the best thing that ever came out. Since your doing this one how about doing simplelearn courses too. There is a YouTuber who says they are the top ten courses and certifications. I told her no employer ever ask or heard of that crap!. Thanks again"
"HOW TO TAKE IT FOR FREE: Check with your library! My library has free access to Coursera, I wouldn't've been able to take the course without it!"
"So if you don’t have any type of knowledge about cybersecurity but interested in learning, where would you recommend starting?"
This course isnt of any value in the job market but it’ll definitely help you test the water before diving into it.
"I will preface that i don't think this cert is a replacement for Security +. Sec + is the baseline cert to have. With that said.... While I appreciate your full review and take on this, I would have to disagree that it belongs in the trash. I think it's a fresh take on introducing the same tired material we all drone on. I do like that there are a variety of people offering their stories of getting into the industry as well as some descriptions of what they do in the field. Most trainings I've seen are just shotgun bootcamp style trainings to pass a test. There is a lack of hands on training for people that are just studying theory for certs. I also would say that while Python might not be a requirement, it is definitely a skill to level up from someone that is a monitor of a network. There's a wide variety of skills and focuses and I think the course has done a great job of introducing this material with very short courses so it's not overwhelming."
So what course would you recommend? I have zero knowledge of anything related to cybersecurity but I want to start somewhere & I’m considering Coursera just because it’s something and not nothing and is priced relatively cheap.
If I already have security+ is this course still worth doing? Attempting to gain all the certs I can because I only hold an associates degree. My other option would be to obtain a BS.
"I think google course serves it's role perfect. It won't land you a job, but it probably the best intro for a newbie in cybersecurity, and is good prep leading into the first real cert that holds some weight, sec+"
"I mean, if you finish in four days you didn’t actually go through the course you just skipped through all the lessons and videos, and then took the tests. How would you know if it’s a good course or not?"
"Hi Jon. I really appreciated your video. But as a novice who is trying to understand the mysteries of this incredible new world, I was under the impression that this Google Certificate would at least guide me in a direction. One thing that I would have appreciated is alternatives. If this certificate is not up to par with the industry's current standards, what pathways would you suggest for someone like me to begin learning and growing? I look forward to reading your response."
"Hey Jon, I stumbled onto your channel as I’m trying to get validation for this course as I’m currently taking it. I’m about finishing up course 2 and  after watching your video I’m kind of second guessing on finishing off this program. \n\nQ: what is the preferred route to take for learning/studying? \n\nI was thinking of picking up a compTia network and security + at my local bookstore & learning  from there. I’m taking the google course only cause I’m new to the IT field and don’t know too much terms and how everything works but I’m willing to put in the time and effort to learn it. Also google cert helps prepare for the compTia sec+ exam all the more reasons I am taking this course. \n\nMuch mahalos,\n\nDom"
I know my page is about fishing but my day job is in IT. I finished the course in 7 days. As a seasoned IT professional with over 20 + years of experience I used it as review and to get ready for the CompTIA Security + exam. I think it's a good course for beginners. Will you get a job after you complete it? It doesn't hurt to have it but you won't have people knocking down your door.
I took the course last month as someone with no cybersecurity experience. Now studying for my Security + attempt next week I'm finding that the Google Cybersecurity Professional course didn't help me at all while preparing for this exam. Also that voucher discount code for 30% off can be found online. Anyone considering the course: don't waste your time
"Thanks for your honesty.  Too many influencers hawk these courses and I'm glad you called it out.  Whenever someone shoves a course in my face, I click away from the video."
"You finished it on 17th Sep and I started it 2 days later. It took me a month to complete and it felt quite overwhelming to me because I was and still am completely new to Cybersecurity.\nIf you didn't like this course, you definitely don't like Coursera in general, because in my experience, the Google Courses are the most well-structured that I tried there. I started the IBM course before starting the Google one and it was really shitty: poor audio quality and very amateur PowerPoint presentations, for instance. \n\nOverall, I liked the course but I have been doing projects and trying other platforms because I feel like I keep forgetting most of the stuff. More than 8 or 9 months have passed since I started taking Cyber courses and I'm still lost and haven't landed my 1st job yet."
I took this course and finished it in 6 weeks thinking it would prepare me for the security + exam.  I then took a practice exam and was stumped. I don't see how anyone can pass that exam with this course alone.
What course would you recommend for starting in cyber security?
I am just about to start the google course. I have the $1 black Friday coursera deal.\n\nI only have another 16 days on it though. \n\nI have zero knowledge of Cybersecurity but im looking for the best way to get started.
Hey I get the problems you listed here are quite substantial and worth taking in consideration while looking for a course as this one. Please recommend good courses at a reasonable price that get the job done.
"O: I appreciate this video, coming from someone who is considering of  taking on this certification course. Thank you.  So my question is: what's your advise , which certification should someone take, if he or she is a total beginner?"
Great video! I’m currently starting out with Microsoft’s cybersecurity course. It sounds very similar to Google’s course but with an emphasis on Azure and Windows. In the video you mentioned how Google focused on Linux instead of Windows. Does Microsoft’s course holds more value than Google’s because of it?
" @JonGoodCyber  Yes, the Coursera one. I’m treating the Microsoft course as a building block towards towards Sec+ and getting a cloud cert. I have no expectations as far as landing a job once I finish the Microsoft cert. Thank you for taking the time to respond!"
Witch course should we go for then ? Witch certification should we get ?
"Look , as someone who has a professional certificate from an actual university and has obtained two college degrees, I am here to tell you that these professional certificates are just to get your foot in the door. These courses are there to give you core information and if Coursera has left anything out of the learning curve like, Windows and etc, then you will pick that up as you go. If you want everything covered in your certificate, you need to go to college and learn the science from ground up and all of that missing information can be learned there. Some peoples expectations are too high, 39.99$ a month is not tuition. It is a subscription fee for data and information that you may complete by a reputable and professional source though. I hope that helps moving forward."
hey there mr Jon Good. I am soon to be in my senior year of high school and my library offers the google cybersecurity cert. I was thinking about taking it over the summer.\n\nTLDR: do you think this course would be good to dip my toes in the water as a high schooler?
"Google Technical Support Certificate deals with mostly windows but they also push the chrome OS as well. The google cybersecurity course helps with preparation for security+ and with the concept of Linux system, it is shown base on the fact that most pen testers use it for EH and windows is barely used for it."
I like your honesty by conpleting 100% of each course.
"Thank you for your nice review! I was thinking about to apply this course.\n\nI have Kali Linux, BlackArch and with most of the famous tools experiences and i also have my own lab to test out everything. \n\nI just need a certificate, so i will take a look into this course and i dont need any Kali training from this course, since i already have the skill. So this is def. good for me!"
" @JonGoodCyber  Yeah true! Thanks for your answer & explanation. \n\nIn my country cant easily get into any IT- job without a actual education, even i have more then 10 years experience in IT- but they still rely on people who have education instead... Even i have done in my job are not enough for them to take me. \n\nWhen HR sees that i don't have education in IT- from a school. They will not take me. Even i have done real life job in IT- and helped to fix software issues with many companies and customers.\n\nI started to learn Cyber Security basics and IT- stuff since 2009. I got a phone repair and a customer service job since 2013 and also in that time i have done many IT- support for customers and after work i've learned more and more online. I also started iOS Jailbreaking since 2009 and i'm also familiar with terminal commands etc... because with Jailbroken iPhone, i have played a lot with terminal like installing package, remove, fix dpkg, SSH and file browsing etc...\n\nThere have many Cyber Security job in here which requirements are very simple (mostly have based IT- skills and knowledge in OS and system understanding) and when i got answer from every HR, they said that is nice to hear i have knowledge and interest, but they take people who are mostly student or after graduated as IT- or Cyber security educations...\n\nSince i have basic & Advanced Cyber Security knowledge, but there have still something i haven't learned are in this Google Cyber Security course, so i'm just gonna get this google cert in Cyber Security and lets see if they will take me or not."
"he is selling a course, of course he will sell you his or he would've recommended a Cert in this video that you can take instead of the google one."
"What about the IBM one on Coursera, have you tried that one?"
"Overall, would you say that the Google course gives a boost for someone looking to prepare and earn an industry certification (comptia security+) in cyber security?"
hello Sir first of all thanks for providing this content I had one question if I purchase One course for 1 month and not completed within it does my course expire?or does it asks for another Payment?
Absorb all info you can just dont expect a job from any degree or any certs its a combo of those things and entry level work. I can see benefiting from it before taking professor messer course back when i took security plus. It serves a purpose. People have no concept of what to deep dive in in the beginning
"Thanks for the info, I was really thinking about taking this course but wasn't too sure about it. Now I know, I'm glad you shared that info, cuz I don't really need this course. Thanks!"
Think you are better investing your resources on security blue team or some form of practical certification. The depth you get in a coursers is kinda superficial imo
Hey thanks for the honest review..\nI have enrolled for the google course in cybersecurity like a montha ago.\nSo after watching your video i got struck in dilemma of what to do further..\nCould you please recommend me the better cybersecurity program which provides internship either..?
"Due to a grant I signed up for through the NYS Dept of Labor, I don’t actually have to pay for the course. With that said, would you still say that the course is a waste of time seeing as I don’t have to actually spend money on it?"
"Hi Jon, so what I understood from your video is that cybersecurity course is a waste of time? I'm in my course 2 and I'm not sure if should continue with the cybersecurity course cerifcate."
"I appreciate your insight, I’m half way through the course.. I was wondering why there was no window OS been discussed.. Please what path do you suggest for someone like me projecting towards cloud security and application security?  Looking forward to your response… thanks again for the videos!!"
"Thank you very much! I'm an argentinian Systems Engineer (Similar to a Cs. Science Bachelor) that is trying to make his way into cybersec, and all the people are talking like you'd get this certificate and land a job instantly. Do you think that I could land a job with my degree and only one cert /course ?? Greetings"
"What s funny enough, I got a problem with their IT Support Professional cert. Their networking part of the course to be precise. One of the reasons why I went with the IT Fundamental Plus cert"
Hahah me too a recently completed it and it was rough… not a great course but it did help I won’t lie
Thanks a lot for this great review! Which equivalent course would you recommend that would cover what google claims to cover?\nNot from an employers poibt of view but rather as someone that needs the experience and knowledge as a freelancer
"Hey, i am starting my career in cybersecurity, i started with the microsoft cybersecurity course and looking to take the microsoft sc-900 exam and go on with sc-300 & sc-100. My question is, is that a good path to land a job in cybersecurity?"
Also what do you think of the Microsoft course?
So what is the best online course to take in order to get a job in cyber security?
While completion of each course we get a certificate right so do u have your name in it ? \nBeacuse i cant see mine. I've already completed three courses of it \nPlz reply
 @JonGoodCyber  instead of my name its showing courseera learner ...what does that mean ?
" @JonGoodCyber  understood however I don't know why anyone would try to get into cybersec without having any idea about the file system, OS, active directory, basic networking principles, being a tech supper user etc\n\nI think they should recommend the IT support course first"
The weak part of these coursera courses is the testing. Passing the exams is absolutely trivial and most of the more elaborate assignments don't amount to much in terms of challenge either. The cert of completion proves little more than that you took the time to sit through it. Hence why its paramount to get true certification like security+ afterwards and prove you can pass a properly proctored exam.
"If a course is not helping you land a job, it's not worth it. Simple as that. I got the Google because I heard it was great and cheap but despite getting it, I can't find a job to save my life lol. I have other certs too (like A+ and Qualys) but even with those the Google Cybersecurity Cert doesn't seem to be helping me at all and you NEVER see it on job listings... ever... literally not one time and trust me, I've checked lol."
Do we get a certificate for each course or do we only get one certificate for all the 8 at the end?
"Hlo sir thank you for your honest opinion , but it would be a great help if you can tell some better alternatives to this course if this is not that good , i mean which will be more in depth about cyber security for beginners .. pleasee  help"
It seemed more blue team oriented. Love the review it was on point. As someone taking the course I see SQL is uncessary
"I love your hand engagement! And I'm glad you told me about  how they don't teach you anything about kali linux! I'm really interested in kali linux, and need a course to teach me that!  Thank You!"
I am new to IT sector.  I have zero knowledge whatsoever but can I take this course and land a job based on cybersecurity.
"I can't agree with you more, especially for Python discussions. The course stressed the importance of Python - probably because Google wants to hire people with Python skills. I know this is sponsored by Google, it doesn't talk anything about Microsoft or Apple environments. The course was good recap for me to review the knowledge, but definitely not a universal recommendation for the people who has not yet worked in cybersecurity in the past."
"Are people getting jobs with these courses though? That's my worry. I wanna begin, but if someone's gonna tell me I need a degree and close the door on me, then what's the point "
Is it ok to take this course just for a label to put in my resume and then gather more info through other sources?
"I really appreciate your honest review of this Course for, I'm using it to prepare myself for SECPlus which I think is worth it also we shouldn't expect them to Cover it All."
What courses or programs do you suggest for getting training in CyberSecurity?
Anything on Coursera that you think is better?
"Theres the Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst and the IBM Cybersecurity Analyst in Coursera but I think Security + certification is seen more like an industry standard for business to hire someone\n ""just my opinion please don't hang me""."
What course do you recommend to get started then ?
"It's pretty refreshing to see an actual honest review (and not one that just starts off with a misleading premise then pushes you to an affiliate link). It's also pretty impressive that you actually took the course. I've been considering trying to get into this field, but after doing some research it seems the prevailing opinion is that this course really isn't going to give you a leg up unless you are already working in IT (helpdesk at least) and you aren't likely to be able to leverage the certificate to get even an entry level cybersecurity job. Thanks for putting in the work and insight to actually add value and not just manipulate traffic."
Only reason Im doing the Google cert is because my public library got me a free coursera account.  Figured might as well.
The Google cert is better than security +  from a learning and experience standpoint….IF you actually execute cybersecurity tasks in as a part of your portfolio.
Jon as a beginner I was waiting in your conclusion to hear some best cyber security foundational courses in comparison to Google unfortunately didn’t happen .
I applied for this course but charge of 1488 shows on the Coursera page… This is not free of cost training programme
Just signed up for this course and then watched this video. It may or may not be good but as a beginner like myself I hope it's enough to get my feet wet. I want to be an ethical hacker someday and one of the certifications I would need Comp TIA Security +. If google is going to give me 30% off of that cert then I'll take it lol. Just hate the idiots that try to make it seem like its all that though. So money hungry nowadays.
"Hello, please I need a guide. I am about to venture into cyber security and I am confused as there are loads of courses on Coursera and I don't know the course to start with. I am a total newbie and I will love to also take on a mentor as I am ready to learn."
what are your thoughts on Microsoft course?
"great review. The Google course may be good for some, but thank you for an in depth and fact filled review. I know (without having to slog through a few modules) that the Google course is not the course I'm looking for."
"Interesting video, it helped me, since i've took notice with what google and coursera is pushing. So maybe make a video about the certificates that are in fact worth doing, for beginners and intermediates please? :D"
can you please share & recommend some good courses on coursera related to Cybersecurity and Ethical hacking
Q: Can anyone provide the best certification course(s) for Cybersecurity. Thank you in advance.
"I know 0 about cybersecurity, and i guess this course is not great, but since my university is giving it to me for free,  i guess I'll take it to know the basics and not go blind into a course that's actually gonna be worth my money ️"
"Thank you for the information. I couldn't wrap my head around a several hours a day, 6 month course being entry level. (isc)2 cc to Sec+ it is!"
Sir I enroll in cyber security course three days ago I choose first foundation of cyber security can I get certificate after 6 month or I will complete the all course is compulsory for certificate means I spent four years there are 8 course of Cyber security please give me answer?
It is good to do only one course?
Is there an affordable legit course that you know of that will land me a good job?
A lot of coursera seems off. Like too much introduction and taking forever to even get into the topic. Seems cringy and felt like no progress was made in actual knowledge or development.
"You're acting as a hater. This is a very beginner course and it's the best of its kind among the rest. I've intentionally done like 5 or 6 beginner courses and none can be compared to this. If it belongs to the trash, tell us what, in your opinion or to you, it's the best."
"I'm sure they aren't getting any decent jobs from such an introductory course. My understanding though, is that it was very effective at introducing new cyber students to the different paths of cybersecurity."
"In a seasoned IT professional's view the course may seem lacking but for someone who trying to get their feet wet for the first time, I think it's a good course and it may even get you in the door.\nI will take entry level IT position any day over flipping burgers."
"You can get Coursera monthly for I think $59/month, first month $1, which is where I'm still at, planning to finish this weekend.\n\nI think of this course a relatively painless way to familiarize myself with vernacular, methods, and tools so that I know what to study on my own as well as reinforce that I actually do know things. \n\nThank-you for this."
"I work at a Cybersecurity academy in a military setting. I did this course sort of for a laugh.\n2 things. \n\n1. the first 7 days are unbilled which is why you and I got it free.\n\n2. Calling it trash is a bit much, you know a lot and respect practical over theory, for a rookie, this is a decent opener which can be done in 2 or 3 months at a guess for a rookie"
i am currently on course 4 and whatever you said is absolutely correct but they are much better than my college teachers
"Bottom line is: you won’t get a job by just completing this course, but… it’s a great introductory material, so I wouldn’t entirely rubbish it."
"If you talk long enough people can just take the course. Is the course career worthy, yes or no."
"so i should use the free trial and finish the course in a week,  sounds good to me !"
"This \n""The online specialization named in this certificate may draw on material from courses taught on-campus, but the included courses are not equivalent to on-campus courses. Participation in this online specialization does not constitute enrollment at this university. This certificate does not confer a University grade, course credit or degree, and it does not verify the identity of the learner."""
"I've seen so many ""legit"" creators and youtubers promoting this course and claiming its enough to get a job with it alone..\nTruth is its not and no course alone can guarantee a job I'm saying this as someone who applied to several jobs"
Name a better entry level course that has hands on labs .
Now wait a dang on a minute you said you completed all eight courses in 4 days but it's 170 hours....... huh?
"4 out of 8 courses done 91.55% \n\nalongwith learning networksecurity,firewall & Splunk"
You should add courses that are better than this one instead of just mocking.
"Bullshit, plenty of people in IT working off just certificates. Not to mention Google never tells you you can take sec+ upon finishing the course. They give you a discount toward the exam and study aids. Nice try"
Funny he says this and yet other people in the industry say it’s a good course for introduction
"It's completely worthless. You can take 8 tests. Get the cert. Not watch a single video; and you get multiple attempts. Total course can be completed in less than 45 minutes; I took the ACTUAL CLASS like you did. Watched everything (skipping ahead on videos I already knew since I just passed my Comptia Sec+ and just wanted the dual badge for online resumes. My cousin worked as an IT HIRING HR PERSON FOR GOOGLE HERSELF, and at Christmas this year; told me to my face, struggling in the industry that she wouldn't even bother looking at my Github; she threw anything in the trash that wasn't a harvard style resume, and when I quizzed her on people lying on resumes and not knowing anything and getting jobs being a huge problem; and youtubers pushing complete lies about these certs qualifying you for a job. This type of fake certification nonsense is what's destroying the industry, aside from Machine Learning Models, which will replace 80% of IT jobs in the next 2 years."
Probably most of Coursera courses are trash.
" @JonGoodCyber  i respect your view and i'm aware of your Technical knowledge but like i said and will confidently say again. just reading a concept  will never beat reading a concept and applying it in a training. you're talking to somebody who have a tech qualification also and i did sect+ as a model. it's overrated for the price, it's overrated for the status it has. it's a highly endorsed cert that's why we all have to take it and that's the true. i will wait for 701 training when it comes out and i will buy your course just to proof my point.... take care Sir.."
" @JonGoodCyber  my point is,  how does this benefit a hiring company, if someone isn't held to any standard at all?  I could probably Google all these answers and get a certificate.  There's no real accountability.  And if I mess up, I can just keep trying until I ""pass"".  \n\nI know I'm probably overthinking this.  But it just doesn't seem like it really does anything at the end of the day, except make Google/Coursera rich."
"Seems like a comprehensive course, but I’m curious how quickly I can complete it if I’m doing this part-time."
Has anyone taken this course already? How was the learning experience compared to what’s advertised?
"Sounds great, but how does it compare to other UX courses out there? I’m trying to decide between this and another program."
This UX course looks pretty cool! I’m curious if it’s as hands-on as it sounds
"I’ve seen mixed reviews. Is it worth the money, or just another flashy course?"
Quick Q—are the tools they teach in the course industry-standard or just basic stuff?
"Do you get feedback on your portfolio projects during the course, or is it mostly self-directed?"
Is this course more recommended than google one ?
I’m ready to dive into this course

Coursera is better than udemy as it takes tests
"As someone almost done with the program, I’d say take it with the intent of taking the CompTIA A+ exam at the end of the course. The course does offer a joint Google IT Support/CompTIA A+ certification which I think is awesome"
"I was just about to ask if you knew of a CompTIA A+ course available in Coursera. You da man! I love your accent, BTW!"
Kindly its just a course then they give certification ? or in final there is an exam ?
this is a perfect course! recommend
I live in Ethiopia I worked in IT before. I want to take this course how do I do that? Currently I'm unemployed and I want to learn.
"I started taking the first two courses a few months ago after taking the Google Analytics certification, because I am working in marketing. I found them content to be pretty basic as well, very introductory, I stopped the course and started studying for the Marketing science meta certification by myself (I already have knowledge in statistics, Python and data modeling) by watching the blueprint videos and lectures. I passed at my first attempt, and I can say the most important thing is to understand the basics of Facebook products for data analysis, hypothesis, interpretation of MMM models, conversion and brand lifts."
"I really loved the course 3 of this certificate, I absolutely didn't feel any inconvenience about a bit dark background of the instructor, his manner of presenting the material was quite good and the content itself seemed great to me. This course sparked my interest for statistics and motivated me to take an in-depth statistics course. Actually, Google Analytics certificate is missing statistics completely (I'm right now in the last course of it) and in my opinion it is hard to do a thorough and in-depth  analysis of data without the knowledge of statistics. So I would really recommend course 3 to those who have completed Google analytics certificate."
"Thanks for reviewing this, I have just finished some parts of the Google analytics course so I'm trying to find what to do next. I think the Google course is a little bit basic if you have analytics experience already, although I did learn things from the course that will help make me a more well rounded data analyst.  Great content as always "
"Hey, I'm that ""character"" from the 2nd course!  Only watch 7:20 to 9:35 (especially @8:50), the part where it's about me & my part! \n\nBut more seriously, a buddy of mine follows you and I just so happened to check you out via them where I saw this review of the Meta course I helped build! I won't comment too much about the course & your review but I will say I think it's fair coming from a data analyst and there's always room for improvement for the team.\n\nI actually work full-time as a data scientist / machine learning engineer but I teach & help develop technical courses on the side. But I usually go the ""off-camera"" route or do live recordings (I used to be a data science instructor / curriculum developer at a boot camp, Flatiron School, where I would do live lectures). Frankly, it's nice to hear your relatively positive comments on the part I helped build and lead!\n\nI personally try to constantly improve (maybe my ""stage presence"" could be better ) but I won't lie and say that it didn't make me feel proud that you generally liked my section  I could easily see creating a whole course from just a couple weeks of the Python section, but of course there are real world restrictions & limitations that come into play in building a full course like this. And I am obviously biased towards my section since it's what most closely what I do in my day-to-day lol\n\nAnyways, thanks for sharing your opinions in this review! I know everyone on the team & I are always looking to improve! I've been wanting to go back and make more explanation YouTube videos on data science, machine learning, and software development so this has personally been helpful!\n\nI couldn't ask for a more honest and independent review from a data analyst! Keep it up!"
"This was super informative! I graduated college about a year ago with double majors in business analytics and marketing and have been thinking about getting into more marketing analytics type work after working with more general data (and some heavy/advanced financial/accounting data - not my cup of tea) at my current job. I have the data background and general marketing knowledge, but not much experience in specific marketing analytics techniques - that part of this course may be interesting!"
"Thanks for the review Alex!\n\nSince I started my journey in the Data Analytics field, I have the feeling that Udemy courses made by ""expert individuals"" are more practical and better suited than those from big universities or companies. \n\nI am currently half-way the DA Google certifcate and although it is very well explained and the content goes straight to the point, it feels a bit slow and full of  things that in my opinion are important but secondary such as: communication, CV preparation, ethics...\nI had another bad experience with a popular Javascript course from Hapwkings University...\n\nWhereas other courses that I took about Python and ML taught by particulars are more focused on the skills. \n\nI guess we have to balance the possibility to get a valid certification and the actual content we learn. \n\nThanks again, love your content!\n\nCarlos.-"
I disagree with the part where you said clustering is not related to marketing analytics... A lot of companies do use clustering for customers segmentation before they ads. I am not sure abt the context in this particular course though.
"Great review & feedback Alex !\n\nI myself am a data analyst who used to be a digital marketer / traditional marketer.\n\nThis entire Coursera Specialization is highly geared ONLY ( as Alex already stated) for those wanting to be in the Marketing Analytics space. I’d also like to add a few things:\n\n1. Even if you’re a generic or non marketing analyst, having digital marketing skills is still a good add on or even as a part time / side hustle .\n\n2. For this like me going into Marketing Analytics, this entire specialization gives you a FREE VOUCHER for the META certification exams. \n\n\nGood luck everyone ."
"Alex, Meta is launching five new courses this month, one of them is Database Engineer. But to review them need to wait till 2023 as the courses are released bit by bit"
Currently on my first course of the specialization. It isn't something I already don't know but it's a great collection of information considering I am a self learner.
Should i go to School for marketing  or just get my knowledge from websites like coursera?
thanks for the video! Could you please give me a hint? I am currently working as a seo specialist and I have a desire to develop further in marketing to eventually come to marketing operations. Is this course going to help me get closer to that goal or should I just take a digital marketing course?
"Thanks for this, Alex! I feel like Marketing Analytics is a hugely underserved domain, considering what a staggering amount of money is involved. \n\nAlso because that's where I work, and it hurts my feelings that more attention is not paid... \n\nI'm working through the Google Digital Marketing course, which is fascinating but not super Analytics-focused."
 @AlexTheAnalyst  it was cool to see that they had an entire course on MTA and MMM. I might go straight for that one - that's what my work section does.
They have updated this certificate since your last review. They've added a dedicated SQL and Python course
Thanks for the video Alex - would you say your video on best courses for data analysis from earlier this year is still up to date or would you add any other course there?
"It seems they updated the course. \n2 new sections were added: \n1. Data Analysis with Spreadsheets and SQL - 25 hours\n2. Python Data Analytics - 25 hours\n\nThe total time to completion increased to ""7 months at 10 hours a week"""
"Hi Alex, if I’m only interested in the marketing data analytics part of the course (I have finished the google data analytics certification, have python and sql knowledge as well). Do you recommend only taking section 4 and skipping the rest?"
"Thank you for reviewing this course, I Have question about what courses recommended about finance for data analysis ???\nAnd thank you again \nHave a nice day"
Do I need to know about coding to learn this course? I mean what if I have no knowledge right off the bat?
Thank you for your comment. I was initially considering taking that certificate until I found out it is issued by Meta Platforms. Your input has helped me make my decision. I will continue to search for other marketing analytics certificates.
"I am close to finish the Google Data Analytics professional course, so what's your recommend for this course? Do I need to do this or not necessary?"
"Hello Alex, i already finished the google data analytics course, what course would you recommend for someone with interest in business abal"
Nice review. Are you done with the google challenges ? Btw I also got the same link upon completion of the course.
How much time would it take to complete the course with 4-5 hrs everyday? I've already completed google data analytics course.
"Alex, i did all and passed first five courses. The last one I did not do as the course was NOT launched yet and not worth paying USD49 for continue.\n\nYeah the data grading really a low blow"
please make review about the update since they add 2 course into it with python course
I took his course and I share the same sentiment about the course being a bit boring and the support for the data analytics course was poor after running into a grading issue
Sir now I am pursuing integrated mtech 5 years course specialization in data science now I completed 3rd can you please say how to and how much I need to prepare to get decent job as fresher in data science sector because there are vast number of topics I am very confused like upto how many concepts I need to cover as a fresher to get decent job in data science sector
"I agree. It looks pretty basic. As someone learning Python, I wouldn't go for it. \nAlso Alex, you can always increase the playspeed of the videos. Saves times.\nFinally, I hope those Meta lectures don't come after you for your honesty "
"how long does it takes to do this course? and can you do it in a short amount of time? meaning, if it takes like 3 months, can you do it in a few days instead?"
"Hey Alex, Thanks for the info as always. \nBeing from such a large and well-known company I wonder if they will update the course or keep it more META specific."
"Boy all that negativity and you gave it a 6?  Based on your underwhelmed analysis, you should have given it a 3 or 4.  \n\nThanks for your review of this course!"
New Meta courses here: https://www.coursera.org/meta-professional-certificates
Did he switch from marketing to a data analytics course midvideo without saying he’s switched
"The course is great, but I wish there was more info on advanced SQL queries and data modeling"
Would you say this is more comprehensive than the Khan Academy’s free data courses? I’m on a budget
I'm skeptical about online courses in general. Can they really prepare you for a data analyst role?
May I ask you to suggest more data analyst courses?
Meta Data Analytics course - that already sounds legit!
"This sounds like a good deal, especially with Coursera Plus. But I wish it was a bit cheaper"
Do I have to know code to get into this course?
"If you need course reviews, look no further than this YouTube channel. Appreciate your work, Daniel!"
Can anyone confirm if the course has subtitles or translations available for non-English speakers?
"I’ve seen a lot of high ratings for courses, but how do we know they’re effective in the real world?"
Does anyone else find it funny that a course about business analysis includes so much ‘hands-on’ work? 
Is English subtittle is Available In Course ??\n@Daniel-Dann
I successfully passed this certification program. Pretty good courses with nice explanations especially parts with data modeling and data analysis & visualization.
I just finished this course\nI loved it.  But the SQL is very very short of time.
Can you make more videos related to data analytics and data science? Especially good course reviews.
i have a question guys i have enrolled for this course on 15th December and it's going to end on 15th March. can i still access the content of the course and able to get the certificate if i won't be able to complete it within 3 months? please answer this question.
Have you completed the course? How long did you take to complete it?
Can i download learning video till my subscription coz I don't have wifi or i can do access in mobile
How long does it take to learn Power BI from this course?
Can you also please do a video on the Business Analytics specialization by UPenn on coursera?
I have a question if someone can help. I want to take the Microsoft Power bi data analytics certification from the offcial Microsoft website. Would getting the certificate from coursera perpare me for the actual exam to earn the certification? I appreciate all the answers.
If I buy this course can I download learning video for a month
if i complete week 1 of the course in 1 week shall i be able to complete the course in 5 months?
"Hi, whats the difference between completing Microsoft Power bi data analyst course and Writing PL-300 exam in Microsoft? Whats the use of coursera professional certification course? Whats the difference between completing the coursera course and Writing PL-300 exam?"
I use PowerBi. My girlfriend currently takes these courses. As I see they are great for beginners.
Can this course hlp in my resume for MBA colleges
Is it free certificate course or ?
How much is this course???
Will you prepare your own course about Power Bi?
"I was searching the ""AI For Everyone"" course is updated or outdated and have found your video...Thanks Matej for your valuable content. "
"Nice review Matej!\n\nI'm deciding between this courser and the one from Harvard, the CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence :/"
Does it have video's to see of just information to read.? \n\nAnd do you have any idea about \nApplied AI course
"Which is better to start learning, AWS or Azure?"
the Maths for Machine Learning specialisation was one of the first that i've ever done on Coursera. and it's still my favourite set of courses i've done on Coursera so far.
"Thank you for this recommendation, Giles. I just completed the entire course. tl;dr: I'm glad I did it, it's a great course overall and I would recommend people take it, bu unlike you, the reason I also found the PCA course (i.e. the third and last part) the weakest isn't because the teacher wasn't as personable as the previous two. For those interested, read below for my full impressions of that part:\n\nI didn't really mind the fact that the third teacher doesn't really connect with the viewer. Yes, they don't smile much and they don't have the same kind of energy as the first two teachers, but as long as the pedagogy is there, it's all good... But that's the issue really: the teacher and the content make too many assumptions about the students, and the pedagogy felt lacking as a result.\n\nEven if the course is labeled ""intermediate"", it's supposed to be the logical progression of courses 1 and 2, and it feels like anything but that. Mathematical concepts, formulas and notation are often glossed over in a sentence, with few visual or concrete examples, such that you're very quickly overwhelmed if your math knowledge isn't already way beyond what was expected in the other two courses. When you're not already really comfortable with (from my point of view) fairly advanced maths, too much abstraction can be very intimidating and a complete motivation killer. You just end up feeling like you're an idiot or like mathematics just aren't for you.\n\nThe course content is lighter (4 weeks only), yet at the same time, it covers far more complex topics, and it often feels like much less effort was put into it. For example, the teacher often defaults to giving you reading material - some of which is quite heavy on esoteric notation that is barely covered, if at all - instead of making explanatory videos. Another example: the feedback on quiz questions, most of the time, amounts to ""Great job!"" or ""Incorrect"", with no explanations. The quizzes themselves often feel completely disconnected from the lessons that precede or follow them. They can be extremely easy, or extremely hard, usually with no in-between. And the programming assignments can be strangely worded or contain mistakes at times, which can throw you off as a student. They certainly threw me off, even though I'm already quite familiar with Python and numpy. In other words, the substance of the assignments wasn't necessarily insurmountable - I was shocked how quickly I completed some of them, in fact -, but the way they're framed and explained made some of them more puzzling than they needed to be sometimes. All those aspects are big departures from the teaching style of the previous courses. Lastly, though this was also an issue with the other courses, the teachers and staff barely ever reply to questions on the forum. Not too much of an issue when the course itself is great, but for this third course, it didn't help matters.\n\nI realize I sound very critical, but again, this isn't to say people shouldn't take the course. They should take it, including the third part, if they have any interest in machine/deep learning and they need to brush up on maths. It's easily worth the €40/month - by the way, you can go through the entire curriculum in a month if you can devote 4-6 hours to it almost every day like I inexplicably managed to do. I just wanted to push back a little against what you said in the video, where you seemed to imply that people were unfairly complaining about some of the assignments. From someone who isn't already very comfortable with maths and abstractions but was diligently making their way through all the content regardless, let me emphasize: it's not just that the third course will challenge you and you should just deal with it; it's that it could stand to be improved, or at least give more pointers to helpful external resources (not just a link to a Wikipedia article). Being challenging or intermediate level isn't an excuse for an unbalanced difficulty curve or hasty coverage of complex topics.\n\nI will say this though: that last quiz before the final assignment forced me to do a deep dive on partial derivatives (especially the chain rule) and gave my poor little brain quite a workout. Genuinely thankful for that. And again, the previous two courses alone are worth enrolling for.\n\nLooking forward to more course/book recommendations! :)"
for the third course it would be very good if they include the statistics and probability instead of PCA
"I am still in the second course, and you wouldn't believe me when If I told you that I already finished my Deep Learning specialization, but chose to study this specialization to gain more depth in the related math, and still I am impressed so far by the first 2 courses."
This course was really helpful!. It saved me in my first Master's degree semester.
"excellent review, I would add that using/learning sympy in parallel helped me a lot following the course and understanding the mathematical concepts"
"i had started the course but couldn't find time due to work i would definitely pursue it, now that you recommend it"
"I am was not strong, when it came to maths at school but in in my ""post-high school"" education, I worked really hard and exceeded expectations. So much so, that my parents asked if I had cheated or paid someone to write my exams, lol...but this gave me the belief to overcome these fears I had, related to these ""high school"" shortcomings and changed my perception that DS, ML and AI were realms for other people, not me..... I have become really interested in these fields, ML and AI in particular. I am a long way from reaching my goals but your channel and  recommendation are useful, awesome, insightful and inspiring. PS: His new courses starts today and I just watched this vid! 5th July 2021 - Thank You so much."
Thank you! I've wanted to do this specialization along with a Deep Learning specialization. I am more confident to proceed now :)
thank you for your reviews. really I was confused about this course
"Can you please say how it relates to the Mathematics for Machine Learning book, do you think the book is more comprehensive?"
I am wondering why did they not include any course on probability and statistics in this specialization. I took these courses during my bachelor's in engineering but looking for a resource to revise the subjects. Is there any other specialization that includes a course on probability and statistics that you recommend?
I'm doing the first course and its the best math course I have ever seen. What a teacher!!
"I'm currently planning on taking the IBM AI enginerring course and am considering taking the Imperial College course in order to get my maths up to speed. Maths is far, far, far from my strong subject; I somehow managed to get an o'level and then avoided it until doing an Open University course on maths for science, in which I learnt more than I had in my school years. So... Am I likely to struggle with this course ? Is it a good foundation for ongoing ML & AI study ? Any snesible replies will be welcome. Thanks."
Actually I completed the first course of this specialization and having completed this far Idk why are people commenting that the assignments are hard. In fact those were totally based on lectures. After all this is the price you need to pay to learn something new and earn a certificate from a renowned institution. Otherwise just fast forwarding the lectures and solving just the petty assignment doesn't add any worth to your learning. Rather it is the best course for anyone who wants to equip themselves with the mathematical knowledge needed for machine learning.
I enrolled in this course when i could free because of my school account but i now i cant get a certificate without upgrading my account. So the question is if i add the course in my linkedin without the certificate when i completed the course does it matter that i don't have a certificate?
Does the first course teach enough linear algebra to be able to follow a university level ML course? I already know basic high school LA btw.
"Any recomendations, books or courses for learning algorithms?"
What are your thoughts on their MSc in Machine Learning and Data Science (online)?
"Giles, I was sceptical about this video as I don’t remember you ever anything slightly negative about a book or course you’ve reviewed. So I’m glad you pointed out that the third course is the weakest. However, you were still far too generous. Marc deisenroth has exceptionally poor pedagogical skills and as someone who has used, understood and applied PCA in my work for several years, I felt desperately sorry for anyone who came across this as their first exposure. The third course in this specialisation is simply not worth a student’s time."
Hey Giles. Thank you for the review. Is this course better than the free Mathematics for Machine learning book that you had suggested earlier on your channel? Is it worth to spend money on this specialization when that free book exists? I am asking since you had given a positive review about that book too.
"Hey, if i want to learn this course but can't buy, how can I learn from youtube"
"Hi Gile, any thoughts on Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization course?"
"I agree with the point of that he's a great teacher and that the course is good and all of that, however, it should be noted that I think the course is better looked at as a way to gain a good foundation of the topic. Deep learning has branches such as computer vision, natural language, etc. He's covers them, however, obviously can't go all the way in depth. After the specialization, you should have a foundation of each branch, at leadt the ones covered, but be able to stem off to which to ever one you want. It should also be noted that I'm not saying that the course is covering the intuitions of each branch only, but I am also saying that it will be better suited for a foundation rather than making you an expert in each branch if that makes sense but at the same time, not a full out noob."
"Your justification for why the assignments weren't ""too hard"" was all the convincing I needed that this class is bad. If I have to spend extra time digging in more depth online then there is no point to take that course in the first place. I'll just save some time and go straight to the research online step. Why take a course where they don't teach you what you need to know?"
Please make review on applied ai course.
does this course help us with coding?
"I finished the Deep Learning specialization and would like to take another course/specialization and use my Coursera for students credit on another course. Which of these two is better to put on a resume when applying for a DS/ML/DL job?\n\n -Mathematics for Machine Learning (Imperial College London - this one) \n-Modern Application Development with Python on AWS (Amazon Web Services) \n\nI took part in a hackathon, where we used AWS, so I guess some cloud-based experience would be useful in an industry setting, that's why I am considering that specialization."
Better to take this before or after learning a bit of machine learning?
Can we audit this course for free without the certificate? Will all of the content be available if we audit it? Will the assignment problem solutions be available if we just audit the course?
"What other materials did you use to solve the third specialisation of the course, i had troubles with it . Please include links and videos"
Can't open your courses link.
Having completed the course myself i would say its quite demanding in theoretical level (mathematics) and practical level (programming)...It's not a course for a beginner....
"thanks for the review, but I thought they should have added the Statistics and Probability course as well. I am designing syllabus for Mathematics for Machine Learning for my master's students. I think this is the course which I will consider."
introductory level courses
"Hey! Great Video!\nIf I buy the plus subscription, can I access the DS course along with Algo course."
i facing difficulty how to gave answer in this course please help
"Hi Daniel, can you review Princeton's algorithm course"
please make a feedback video on data engineering course by IBM
"I'm doing this course right now. I started two weeks ago, and now I'm almost finished with it. It's a very nice course. Also, I got a free course after my financial aid was approved. "
Found this course yesterday but weren’t many YouTube videos about it. Perfect timing !
"Hey @fezekile228 I'm thinking of taking this or the meta back-end course. What skills have you gained after this, can you build full stack apps now? I found this course a little bit shallow when I looked through it. What is your take?"
"fezekile, did you have to pay for both the subscription and the course?"
Please how much did you pay for the course?
"I have been taking the course since September. I am on the last bit of the 7th certificate. There are 12 certificates total. It's excruciating to say the least and I am a developer. There are many parts where I do not think someone without prior knowledge would understand or figure out. Also, they barley go over how to do something and then expect you to know how to do it on a test. There is a huge issue with their virtual environments as well, which leaves me spending hours trying to find a fix through forums and blogs. \n\nI am still pushing through, but this course is a mess."
"Please sir, what is better to do? To take just the IBM fullstack certification course or to take the fronted + backend IBM certification courses? Please, I need an answer...thaks a lot for the video!"
"anyone: There some careers assume prior knowledge. If a cloud developer course needs to explain what a network or server is, then you need to exit the course and go learn fundamentals. IT fundamentals are not taught in Cloud."
"Hi, to clarify, do you pay coursera subscription and course subscription? Or does the annual membership give you full access to this course with certification?"
"In broad terms, average, which one has more career opportunities and will pay more money: AI/machine learning specialist or software developer?"
Nice video! Will i get the certificate as long as i complete the courses without additional payment other than my monthly subscription to coursera?
what would you say about ibm fulll stack developer course vs (meta front end and backend course)
"It s been a month I m studying this course, I find it very useful, lots of information, but the exercise part is not as brilliant. I hope that when I start the part with html css and js, there will be more exercises."
"I have recently completed the wev development fundamental and explore emerging tech on ibm. I also have seven years of freelance jog experience from Upwork, Fiverr and Guru. I am a top rated. But need to know are these courses actually worth getting job"
There just one thing I didn't understand about Coursera. Do I have to pay this IBM course separately or it comes with the 380€ yearly subscription?
" @Daniel-Dann  I was talking about this one on the video, the full stack. I win anyway. Coding courses costs 4k where I live"
After reading mixed reviews on this course I have decided to enroll. Does this course help you build a portfolio of projects and examples to show potential employers?
IBM vs Meta full stack web development course
is this course better than udacity fullstack development nanodegree
will the 3 months option be enough to complete this course? also is there a time limit upto when one can join the course or it can be enrolled anytime?
is this course give you a videos of lectures or a online class?
Does this course come with live classes to learn?
Can anyone tell me how much the entire course costs for the whole certificate?
If i complete cloud computing course after html css and js will in get a professional certification (iam applying course wise in financial aid).
"Hey Alex, I just landed a Data Analyst internship for the summer and I am really looking forward to it. Your channel has definitely helped me out. \n\nI am looking forward to taking this machine learning specialization as well. I’m planning out when to commit the time to study. Work will take up so much of my time in the day!"
"I just finished week one of this course. There is definitely some math! If you're like me and its been a minute since you've really had to work through an equation, I would advise just slowing down and making sure you understand what you're looking at before moving on because each step builds on the last. \n\nAndrew Ng is a very good teacher, which is what makes the class work. ChatGPT is also good as an echo chamber. Try to explain the math to it, it will correct you if you get something wrong."
Thanks for sharing this! I was looking for a good ML course and this is exactly the suggestion I needed!
So happy my college actually teaches machine learning in the DA program. So interesting.
Thanks for sharing this you are a great teacher \nMy teacher can i get work after finish this courses ??
"Hey Alex, up to what level of python do you feel is required to take this specialization. Would you suggest to learn some prior math concepts before heading into this course?"
"Hi Shreyas ! I am already taking this course . For python you need to know what functions are , for loops , and what are methods . \nIn terms of math all you need is college level math . And You dont need to go through anything advance as Andrew goes through them in lessons as well. \nOne thing i must mention is that if you dont know python then understanding code will be difficult."
"Python or any programming knowledge or what I call computational thinking. Then for machine learning, you need statistics(300 level), Linear algebra( An absolute must) if you haven’t taken a course in linear algebra you will never understand machine learning period, and then some multivariate calculus and even basic calc. When I took the MITx class in ml it was clear people just didn’t understand what was going on."
"Sad that I have to pay for the specialisation because it is not included in my uni's partnership programme with Coursera, but I think the fee will be worth it :) Thanks for reminding us of Andrew Ng using Python for ML, Alex"
There are 3 courses within this specialisation. You can audit them for free. You will get the whole course just not graded assignments.
"They give you 7 days free trial and it costs $49/month after that. If you can go faster, the total cost will be cheaper. I learned most of these stuff back in school, so I was able to go through these courses fairly quick. I am almost done with the 2nd week of the last course in exactly 2 weeks after starting with this specialization. Coursera planned this specialization for 10 weeks total (3+4+3). But if you do it 5x a week at 1.5 hours ea you should be able to finish it in less than 2 months."
"Hi Alex and everyone, \nPls I need help on how to upload my certificate from Coursera to Upwork. I've tried but Coursera is not among the list of options in the certification. Thank you all"
great efforts in this channel.\nI have only simple enquiry as a new sql learner.\nI haven't made my mind yet whether to use sql server or not. \nIs sql server the best solution available for those who want to manage and automate databases inside a medium size company.\nIs there any alternative i need to consider right from the beginning or any applications that is relevant to integrate with the database being used.\nI consider myself a machine learning enthusiast and and would mostly like to automate business solutions with the engine being used.\nThanks for taking time to read this.. God bless you.
What are the differences to Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng?
Are all the video recordings in the updated course also new?
Hey Alex! I have completed this course 3 months back. Is it worth to take it up again? Although I know R and don’t know Python!
Thanks for the review\nIs the course also useful for ppl who are more into data analytics ?
"Hey Alex,\nThanks for the review! Does this course come with a note? (e.g., a pdf or Jyputer notebook)."
"Hi Alex,\n\nIs this one Specialization course enough to learn Machine Learning and dive into a career related to ML?"
How much money it cost to learn machine learning course from Coursera?
"I have a doubt  , since it is called us Deep learning.ai ..is it just all about deep learning ..or it starts from scratch of ML to Deep learning..of should i do someother machine learning course before taking this... please help me"
You have convinced me to take the course . I paid the $48 let's see how it goes
Not a fan that this is sponsored by coursera. How can anyone be objective in that case
"I took it and was impressed by it (this is Thomas Comerford btw, you responded to a comment of mine earlier today) in that it taught me a lot as a newbie. However, one thing that I noticed is that comparing it to the 4th course in the IBM cert, it doesn't utilize the requests library like the IBM one does. Personally, I think you're better off just skipping it if you're going to take the IBM courses, since the 4th course alone goes over everything and more that the specialization has. The only downside is that the IBM one is very fast paced, and it may feel like you aren't getting a total explanation of the content, so you'll just need to repeat stuff. One thing that you won't get in course 4 of the IBM cert is SQL with Python, but that's because it's another course."
"I have been thinking of opting for this one lately but I am constantly having second thoughts. Can anyone suggest a better course that would be of more value to a potential employer,"
"Hi Greg. I am completely new to the development world with background in sociology. No background in coding whatsoever. I have been wanting to start learning development for the past 2 years, but it is overwhelming not knowing where to start from. Can you please advise?"
which is the best course for python if i have time.
"I have been learning python for 1 month, is it fine to take this course?"
"hi greg, i've just started the IBM data science professional certificate and I'm really excited about it, should I follow it with Andrew Ng's machine learning or deep learning specialization? I really like both but i can't tell which one is better"
"The problem is that most python courses are just like this. Once you get the basics, it becomes very difficult to grow as a programmer through online courses. The best thing past learning the basics is doing a project, reading the documentations and getting good at copying code from stockoverflow."
 @GregHogg  I'm a noob - I think i'll just learn this course on freecodecamp and use actual accomplishments afterwards as credit instead of taking the coursera cert
 @GregHogg  ok we have a bad course give us where to find a good one
I wanted to take this to get CERTIFIED  at python. But i's already familiar with it so what course should I do? To get certified
im not familiar with python so i will take this course \nbut u said its not enough to master the python so what you suggest me to do or a course to take after finishing this one?
Hi \nCan you please review the Data Science Road Map that had been created by Coursera.
I've been interested intrigued with UofM material but I m already in deep in other courses. I'm at the portfolio stage.
can anyone tell me where should i start learning python im completely lost i need free resources and proper guidance please help
Should i do this course or python bootcamp zero to mastery udemy? Which one do you recommend? I am beginner at programming
Hey man where I can learn python intermediate course for free  I will be waiting for your reply
Could you do a review of IBM devops and software engineering from coursera please and is it a good start to become a software engineer?
"Hi Greg, what can you advise someone who wants to make a career change from business entering the IT industry? I have been told about Python but read your comment that its become so common. Which courses are worth doing knowing I will be able to get a job offer? Thanks in advance"
"Hey Greg, thanks for the review, what would you recommend to a newbie like myself to do AFTER this course that probably is in Coursera?"
Hey people i want to ask you that what if i completed all the 5 courses in this specialization?? will i  get a certificated issued by university of michigan??
should i take the third course if i want to become a data analyst
Is this course out dated now?
I just need the best course to help become a master at python ️
can you please do a review on python 3 programming specilization. Im having trouble differentiating between that and this course.
