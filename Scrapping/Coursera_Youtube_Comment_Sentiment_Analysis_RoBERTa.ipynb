      "{'sequence': 'Thank you for this recommendation, Giles. I just completed the entire course. tl;dr: I\\'m glad I did it, it\\'s a great course overall and I would recommend people take it, bu unlike you, the reason I also found the PCA course (i.e. the third and last part) the weakest isn\\'t because the teacher wasn\\'t as personable as the previous two. For those interested, read below for my full impressions of that part:\\\\n\\\\nI didn\\'t really mind the fact that the third teacher doesn\\'t really connect with the viewer. Yes, they don\\'t smile much and they don\\'t have the same kind of energy as the first two teachers, but as long as the pedagogy is there, it\\'s all good... But that\\'s the issue really: the teacher and the content make too many assumptions about the students, and the pedagogy felt lacking as a result.\\\\n\\\\nEven if the course is labeled \"intermediate\", it\\'s supposed to be the logical progression of courses 1 and 2, and it feels like anything but that. Mathematical concepts, formulas and notation are often glossed over in a sentence, with few visual or concrete examples, such that you\\'re very quickly overwhelmed if your math knowledge isn\\'t already way beyond what was expected in the other two courses. When you\\'re not already really comfortable with (from my point of view) fairly advanced maths, too much abstraction can be very intimidating and a complete motivation killer. You just end up feeling like you\\'re an idiot or like mathematics just aren\\'t for you.\\\\n\\\\nThe course content is lighter (4 weeks only), yet at the same time, it covers far more complex topics, and it often feels like much less effort was put into it. For example, the teacher often defaults to giving you reading material - some of which is quite heavy on esoteric notation that is barely covered, if at all - instead of making explanatory videos. Another example: the feedback on quiz questions, most of the time, amounts to \"Great job!\" or \"Incorrect\", with no explanations. The quizzes themselves often feel completely disconnected from the lessons that precede or follow them. They can be extremely easy, or extremely hard, usually with no in-between. And the programming assignments can be strangely worded or contain mistakes at times, which can throw you off as a student. They certainly threw me off, even though I\\'m already quite familiar with Python and numpy. In other words, the substance of the assignments wasn\\'t necessarily insurmountable - I was shocked how quickly I completed some of them, in fact -, but the way they\\'re framed and explained made some of them more puzzling than they needed to be sometimes. All those aspects are big departures from the teaching style of the previous courses. Lastly, though this was also an issue with the other courses, the teachers and staff barely ever reply to questions on the forum. Not too much of an issue when the course itself is great, but for this third course, it didn\\'t help matters.\\\\n\\\\nI realize I sound very critical, but again, this isn\\'t to say people shouldn\\'t take the course. They should take it, including the third part, if they have any interest in machine/deep learning and they need to brush up on maths. It\\'s easily worth the €40/month - by the way, you can go through the entire curriculum in a month if you can devote 4-6 hours to it almost every day like I inexplicably managed to do. I just wanted to push back a little against what you said in the video, where you seemed to imply that people were unfairly complaining about some of the assignments. From someone who isn\\'t already very comfortable with maths and abstractions but was diligently making their way through all the content regardless, let me emphasize: it\\'s not just that the third course will challenge you and you should just deal with it; it\\'s that it could stand to be improved, or at least give more pointers to helpful external resources (not just a link to a Wikipedia article). Being challenging or intermediate level isn\\'t an excuse for an unbalanced difficulty curve or hasty coverage of complex topics.\\\\n\\\\nI will say this though: that last quiz before the final assignment forced me to do a deep dive on partial derivatives (especially the chain rule) and gave my poor little brain quite a workout. Genuinely thankful for that. And again, the previous two courses alone are worth enrolling for.\\\\n\\\\nLooking forward to more course/book recommendations! :)', 'labels': ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive'], 'scores': [0.43482017517089844, 0.3677406311035156, 0.19743916392326355]}\n",
